{"human rights": "1/7  JOINT STATEMENT Human Rights for All Post-2015 10 December 2013  Human rights have surged to the forefront of the debate about what will succeed the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. As human rights and social justice organizations worldwide, we feel compelled to lay out some of the baseline implications of embedding human rights into the core of the sustainable development agenda this time around.  At its essence, a post-2015 framework anchored in human rights moves from a model of charity to one of justice, based on the inherent dignity of people as human rights-holders, domestic governments as primary duty-bearers, and all development actors sharing common but differentiated responsibilities. Accordingly, the post-2015 framework should be designed as a tool to empower and enable people\u00d1individually and collectively\u00d1to monitor and hold their governments, other governments, businesses, international institutions and other development actors to account for their conduct as it affects people\u00d5s lives within and beyond borders. A sustainable development framework founded in human rights can serve as an instrument for people and countries to help unseat the structural obstacles to sustainable, inclusive and just development, prevent conflict and stimulate implementation and enforcement of all human rights\u00d1civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, the right to development,  and to a healthy environment.  The post-2015 framework must then at the very least respect and reflect pre-existing human rights legal norms, standards and political commitments to which governments have already voluntarily agreed. International human rights, environmental and humanitarian law, the Millennium Declaration, as well as related international consensus documents agreed in Rio, Vienna, Cairo, Beijing, Monterrey and Copenhagen and their follow-up agreements must form its non-negotiable normative base.  If it is going to incentivize progress while also preventing backsliding and violations, human rights principles and standards must go beyond the rhetorical, and have real operational significance this time around. Among other things, anchoring the post-2015 agenda in human rights for current and future generations implies that the framework:   1. Upholds all human rights for all. The framework should stimulate improved human rights process and outcomes for all people, especially the most vulnerable, in all countries global North and global South. Along with economic, social,   2/7 cultural and environmental rights, any successor framework must include commitments to protect freedom of association, expression, assembly and political participation if it is to ensure an enabling environment for an empowered civil society, and protect human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, as central agents translating international political commitments into lived realities.  2. Stimulates transparency and genuine participation in decision-making at all levels, throughout all policies including budget, financial, and tax policies. Access to information and meaningful and effective participation are not only fundamental human rights, but will also be critical to developing, implementing, and monitoring an effective and responsive post-2015 framework.  3. Integrates meaningful institutions and systems to ensure human rights accountability of all development actors. Lofty aspirations for a post-2015 agenda will surely fail if proper citizen-led systems of monitoring and human rights accountability are not built into the very DNA of the framework, with clear and time-bound commitments of all relevant actors. While states must remain the primary duty-holder in development, all development actors, including third-party states, the private sector and international financial institutions should be made responsive and accountable for achieving and not undermining global goals. Integrating substantive human rights criteria into assessments of progress towards development goals and commitments means monitoring both the policy and budgetary efforts of governments alongside development outcomes. Any post-2015 monitoring mechanism should complement and reinforce the Universal Periodic Review process for all states.  A framework for ensuring accountability would benefit from constructive interaction with the existing human rights protection regime, as well as other relevant accountability mechanisms. In this context, we call for an accountability framework with binding commitments, supported by effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, to be agreed at the global level. This framework should reaffirm the spirit of the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development and it should be based on three fundamental principles: mutual accountability (donors and partners are equally  accountable for development progress); democratic ownership of partner countries (alignment of donor countries to policy objectives set by developing countries, through inclusive and democratic processes); and inclusive partnerships (participation of different varieties of development stakeholders, State and non-State actors).  4. Is backed by national mechanisms of accountability, such as judiciaries, parliaments, national human rights institutions, reinforced by regional and international human rights mechanisms such as the treaty bodies and the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, so as to ensure the implementation of the post-2015 commitments. The post-2015 development agenda is well-placed to encourage governments to improve access to justice for people living currently in poverty by monitoring measures to eradicate existing barriers.  5. Ensures that the private sector, at the very least, does no harm. The post-2015 framework must reflect current international consensus that governments have a duty to protect human rights through the proper oversight and regulation of private actors, especially of business and private financial actors, to guarantee in practice that they respect human rights and the environment, including in their cross-border activities. At the very least, no governments should allow their territory to be used for illegal or criminal activities elsewhere, such as tax evasion, depositing assets obtained through   3/7 corruption, environmental crimes or involvement in human rights violations, no matter the perpetrator.  6. Eliminates all forms of discrimination and diminishes inequalities, including socioeconomic inequalities. Human rights can only be realised within socio-economic and environmental boundaries if we also reduce inequalities of wealth, power and resources. Governments have a particular obligation under human rights law to protect the rights of the most marginalized and excluded, and to take additional measures to ensure that they enjoy their rights on an equal basis with others. Protecting decent work, and diminishing unfair wage disparities is also fundamental to reducing socio-economic inequality, as is reforming tax and fiscal policy and promoting human rights alternatives to austerity nationally and globally to unleash the resources necessary to finance human rights fulfillment. The timely collection and disaggregation of data on the basis of various grounds of compound discrimination is essential to identify, make visible and respond to inequalities and violations of human rights and to increase accountability. At a national level, data should be collected and disaggregated based on country-relevant factors as defined by rights-holders.   7. Specifically and comprehensively supports women's rights. Addressing gender-based violence, guaranteeing sexual and reproductive rights, ensuring women\u00d5s rights to and control over land, property and productive resources and their economic independence, recognizing the care economy and ensuring women\u00d5s rights to social protection and the equal distribution of paid and unpaid work, and their rights to participation in decision-making are critical, not only to realize women's human rights and achieve gender equality, but for enabling women\u00d5s full and active participation in economic, political and social life.  !8. Enables the currently disadvantaged and commonly discriminated against and excluded groups to be effective agents of their own development by drawing on the provisions of human rights standards aimed at eliminating discrimination on grounds such as race, disability, migrant or indigenous status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.  9. Upholds the legal obligation to fulfill the minimum essential levels of economic, social, and cultural rights, without retrogression. This would imply a focus on universal or \u00d2zero\u00d3 targets, such as the provision of comprehensive social protection floors, universal health coverage, minimum food security guarantees, and other floors below which no one anywhere will be allowed to fall.  10. Tackles structural drivers of inequality, poverty and ecological devastation at the global level. A genuine and balanced global partnership then would enable people and institutions to monitor the common but differentiated responsibilities of all actors to eliminate rather than perpetuate these global obstacles. To be good-faith partners then, governments, business and international institutions must assess the human rights impact beyond their borders of their policies and agreements in areas such as corporate accountability, environment, trade, investment, aid, tax, migration, intellectual property, debt, weapons trade and military cooperation, monetary policies and financial regulation. Existing human rights norms can provide a common set of standards and useful yardstick to assess policy coherence for sustainable development.   At a time of great uncertainty, multiple crises and increasing insecurity and conflict, let us not found the 21st century sustainable development framework on 'bracketed rights\u00d5 and broken promises, but instead on a bold reaffirmation of human rights for all.   4/7  This joint statement is supported by the following organizations:  \"#

In its \u00d2A New Global Partnership\u00d3 report, the High Level Panel of Eminent Persons stated that the rights of freedom of expression, access to information, association, and assembly are essential to achieving sustainable development. These rights are the fundamental building blocks of good governance, empowering people to actively participate in achieving development goals. This brief sets out recommendations on how this can be achieved through clear and measurable targets, building on the recommendations of the High Level Panel.  The right to information Transparency and the free flow of information are widely recognized as central in the promotion of development rights. The High Level Panel stated, \u00d2openness and accountability helps institutions work properly \u00d0 and ensures that those who hold power cannot use their position to favour themselves or their friends. Good governance and the fight against corruption are universal issues. Everywhere, institutions could be more fair and accountable. The key is transparency. Transparency helps ensure that resources are not wasted, but are well managed and put to the best use.\u00d3 To achieve this, the Panel called for a \u00d2New Data Revolution\u00d3 to strengthen the collection of information to meet development goals. To attain this \u00d2Data Revolution\u00d3, an effective legal framework needs to be adopted in each country to guarantee the collection and dissemination of information. The target should ensure that individuals, civil society organizations, businesses, and other formal and informal entities have a legal right to access information held by government bodies and others institutions relevant to their needs. At a minimum, this requires countries to adopt and implement a framework right to information law which sets out minimum standards on the right of everyone to demand information, the duty of bodies to collect, store and provide information in usable formats and without restrictions, and provides for a set of specific limited exemptions, appeals mechanisms, oversight, and sanctions. Over 100 countries around the world including China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico, and Brazil have already adopted national laws or regulations based on these standards. Access can be further enhanced with requirements for proactive publication of information using information and communications technologies and specific sectorial legislation for key issues.  Without this legal framework, there is no guarantee that accurate and useful information be collected and made available to those who need it most.  Freedom of expression The UN Task Team report to the Secretary General stated that, \u00d2Pluralistic, independent media may help raise public awareness about development issues, empowering people with information to better monitor implementation and performance and hold governments accountable.\u00d3  The media (including formal and informal entities and individuals) face barriers in many countries in investigating and reporting on development issues. They are often unable to access important information and face both legal and extra-legal threats, particularly when revealing corruption of public funds, misallocation of money from natural resources, tax avoidance by corporations and powerful individuals to pay taxes and other issues which impact the country\u00d5s economic development.   Targets are needed to promote freedom of expression and eliminate impunity for attacks on the media. UNESCO has already developed high-level \u00d2Media Development Indicators\u00d3 which measure the freedom of the media in countries across a number of issues. Further, full investigation and prosecution for all attacks with a strict zero-impunity target should be incorporated into the likely goal on security.  Promoting civic space The High Level Panel stated, \u00d2Civil society should play a central, meaningful role but this requires space for people to participate in policy and decision-making.  The role of civil society in promoting development has been firmly established in international policy for nearly 30 years - from the Bruntland Commission report, to the 1992 Rio Declaration, the Millennium Declaration, Agenda 21 and most recently in the Rio + 20 \u00d2The World We Want\u00d3 Declaration.  Despite this recognition, restrictive laws and policies have proliferated around the globe to limit core civil society freedoms of expression, association and POSITION PAPER  Ensuring accountability in the Post 2015 Agenda through transparency, free expression and enabling civil society participation   assembly, which are enshrined in international law and necessary for CSOs to effectively operate. CSOs working in many areas \u00d0 particularly those that challenge the status quo, such as promoting a healthy environment, fighting corruption, or advancing other important development needs \u00d0 are at risk of arbitrary closure or other severe sanctions and unwarranted government interference and harassment. Laws and policies in many countries increasingly require CSOs to \"harmonize\" their activities with government priorities in national development plans. These requirements often limit the ability of CSOs to carry out activities intended to benefit marginalized communities or focus on issues neglected by governments. These efforts are counter-productive. In their place, a target of opening up civic space to ensure that the best, most creative ideas and actions to address the overwhelming efforts needed to achieve sustainable development is facilitated.

The availability and accessibility of information promotes transparency, ensures better governance and reduces inefficiency and corruption. Information gives people the opportunity to improve their own lives, participate in the decision-making processes that affect them and hold their leaders to account.  In Senegal, the high instance of obstetric fistula - and the scarcity of information about preventing and treating this devastating injury - strongly demonstrate why access to information is crucial to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.   The challenge An obstetric fistula is an injury to a woman\u00d5s bladder or rectum caused by a long and difficult delivery without proper medical care. Women who suffer from fistulas are often socially ostracised and forced to leave their families due to a lack of understanding about the injury.   A fistula can be caused by a variety of factors, including early marriage and pregnancy, poor medical care during delivery and female genital mutilation. However, the majority of the population, especially those living in rural and deprived areas, is not aware of these. Often, the most affected regions are those that are the most remote. These regions have a very high level of poverty, limited access to healthcare and harmful cultural practices often continue to be imposed on girls and women. T     The Senegalese government, together with international and national organisations, has taken a number of actions to deal with obstetric fistulas, including free fistula reparation treatment across the country. Yet the problem remains. Each year, hundreds of women continue to suffer from this injury due to a lack of accurate information about prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Linking poor access to information to fistula ARTICLE 19 investigated the link between the lack of information and incidences of obstetric fistulas in Tambacounda Province, the area with the highest number of incidences in the country. According to a survey conducted by ARTICLE 19 in Tambacounda, many people have never heard of obstetric fistulas. Many of those who did know about the injury did not know that women can get free treatment. Of 290 people who were interviewed, including 190 women, only 32 had heard of the injury.  The survey confirmed that women do not know where to go or which procedures to follow in order to get treatment. The injury is still surrounded by mystery, taboos and false information about its origins.  Going to medical facilities for information is not common practice in Senegal, especially in regions such as Tambacounda. \u00d2It is difficult to ask for information when you don\u00d5t know where to channel your request or what procedures are in place,\u00d3 reported a survey participant.  SENEGAL  Right to information + maternal health   The outcome: \u00d2Information is a right for all the world\u00d5s people\u00d3 Our experience in Senegal shows that medical programmes alone won\u00d5t be enough to solve maternal health issues. People must know about the programmes and more importantly, know where to ask.  Access to information is the crucial link in empowering women to improve their lives. ARTICLE 19\u00d5s work in Tambacounda, while ongoing, shows early promise in improving maternal health outcomes through better access to information. Our pilot program trained 58 community activists and volunteer health assistants about the causes and treatment of fistulas. As a result, women suffering from fistulas were identified and referred for medical treatment in hospital. More generally, women reported feeling empowered  to ask for information from health centres. They also said that they felt able to share what they had learned about the causes and treatment with their communities.  \u00d2After the training, I got more information about the dangers of fistulas and this allowed me to share this information with my friends and the people in my neighbourhood. I even detected a woman with a fistula. Information is a right for all the world\u00d5s people, just like the right to eat, to dress, to be medically treated.\u00d3 - Ngolo Tamega, Development counsellor in the Pont neighbourhood.       Freedom of expression and information are key in overcoming poverty and improving people\u00d5s lives. The availability and accessibility of information promotes transparency, ensures better governance and reduces inefficiency and corruption. Information gives people the opportunity to improve their own lives, participate in the decision-making processes that affect them and hold their leaders to account.  In Indonesia, parents of poor and marginalised school children used the country\u00d5s Freedom of Information Law to hold schools to account for how they used school funds. This enabled them to claim their children\u00d5s right to quality education.   The challenge Regional differences in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets in education are stark, with remote and poor areas lagging behind. In 2005, the Government launched educational financial reforms to address these education challenges. The reforms were designed to provide incentives for schools to maintain and increase enrolment, and gave schools greater say over how funds are spent in order to meet local needs.  However, studies indicate the lack of access to information has significantly undermined the effectiveness of these reforms. Many parents are not aware of the decisions being made that could affect their children. Schools often fail to communicate information proactively on budgets or the use of funds. The lack of transparency and public monitoring means that any potential misuse       and misallocation of educational funds remains unchecked. Linking access to information to quality education ARTICLE 19 worked with our partner in Indonesia, PATTIRO, to empower local communities to make use of the 2010 Freedom of Information (FOI) Law. The aim of this was to obtain information on education assistance and to participate in decision-making and monitoring of the use of education funds. The project targeted parents in the economically disadvantaged districts of Lebak and Serang in Banten Province, which lags behind others in terms of its education indicators and position in the human development index. Eighty-nine parents in the two districts were trained in how to use the 2010 FOI Law to learn about educational funding relating to their children. As a result of their information requests, the parents were able to analyse school finances. The groups checked the financial budget for the procurement of goods and services and compared it to the appropriate cost of those goods and services. They also conducted a price to value comparison of the quality of goods or services to check on value for money. The outcome: \u00d2Extraordinary\u00d3 results The parents reported their findings to the local school committees. They identified discrepancies INDONESIA  Right to information + education   in the use of funds and notified them of their intention to continue to request the information and to report future discrepancies to the authorities.  The information requests also led to more immediate and personal results. For example, parents who had not previously received assistance from the educational funds asked their schools for the criteria used to decide who would receive school fee and uniform subsidies. Those who discovered that they fit the criteria then demanded their right to education assistance from the schools.  The project was an excellent demonstration of the thirst for information in these communities. One team noted that after some of the Right To Information (RTI) training workshops, parents from other schools were waiting outside to ask how they could receive the same training in their areas.  Parents from both communities reported feeling \u00d2energised\u00d3 by a sense of power and potential as they held local officials to account. The Serang team reported that the results of their financial review were \u00d2extraordinary\u00d3: they had never before thought they could do anything like this to hold the schools accountable.       Freedom of expression and information are key in the battle to fight poverty and improve people\u00d5s lives. The availability and accessibility of information promotes transparency, ensures better governance and reduces inefficiency and corruption. Information gives people the opportunity to improve their own lives, participate in the decision making process that affect them, and hold their leaders to account.  People in rural Brazil are using the Access to Information Law to help them fight for better access to, and a better quality of, water. Through the use of this law, families in Brazil\u00d5s semi-arid region can now find out about and make the most of the support that is currently available to them. They are also campaigning for better services where they are needed. The challenge 2012 and 2013 were the driest years on record in Brazil for three decades. The drought has been most severe in Brazil\u00d5s semi-arid region, where some communities have not seen rain in over a year. Official figures (IBGE 2007) show that 67% of rural families living in this semi-arid region do not have access to a general system of water distribution; 43% use wells and springs; and 24% access water in other ways, including making daily journeys to collect water from sources that frequently are not fit for human consumption. In 2011 Brazil committed to ensuring better access to water across the country. The government established the Water for All       Programme, which aims to provide thousands of Brazilians with clean drinking water. Yet people still struggle to access this water. For example, in the state of Pernambuco in northeast Brazil, water supplies are limited and there are only a small number of water trucks distributing clean water to families who are struggling to cope with drought. Finding about when and where deliveries are made can make all the difference to a family struggling with the drought. Linking access to information to water Information is crucial in order to make sure that the communities most affected by drought get the help they need.  ARTICLE 19 worked with local communities in Pernambuco to train them to use the Access to Information Law in order to: \u00a5 Obtain information about the specific water programmes in the state \u00a5 Find out how much money has been allocated to providing water and how it is being spent, including the number of water trucks in operation  \u00a5 Find out the results of water quality tests in the area. The outcome Ala\u2122de Martins (52) is a farmer who lives in S\u2122tio Solto, Triunfo - a rural part of Pernambuco. She has two grown children and works with her BRAZIL  Right to information + water    husband producing fruit pulps. Ala\u2122de and her husband got involved in ARTICLE 19\u00d5s training workshop after speaking with a local community centre: \u00d2We have an agroforestry area where my husband and I work with organic products. Agriculture is very painful now. A lot has died because of the drought.\u00d3 \u00d2The training involved a number of issues, about rights and duties with respect to sources of water. If we do not inform ourselves and hold the authorities to account, it becomes a forgotten matter.\" Ala\u2122de says that the training showed her how to access essential information that she would not normally know how to get hold of. In particular she was pleased to find out about the delivery of water by tanker trucks during drought periods and the results from water quality tests in the area. \u00d2I learned about the care we need to have with the water, about our duty to find out where it comes from.  When a water truck arrives, we do not know where its water comes from, and whether it is water that comes for human consumption, or if it comes from a dam.\" Ala\u2122de says that a lack of information about the source of the water has been one of the biggest problems facing her community. \u00d2It is through the mouth that people get sick. If you consume unclean water, it can be harmful. Even for animals. What frightens people here in the Northeast is that the drought killed a lot of cattle. People do not usually bury the animal, but place it in an open grave. When the rain comes, the water washes the remains of the animals into creeks, dams and rivers such as the Paje\u0153. This can contaminate the water. Some dams are not good [water sources] for that reason.\"  By learning to access information about the water quality tests and delivery locations, local families are getting the help they need to survive the drought.  More importantly, they are learning to speak up and ask questions of those in positions of authority. \u00d2My husband is very shy. I was like that too but I overcame my shyness [through the training].  Now, I talk and participate a lot.\u00d3      Freedom of expression and information are key in overcoming poverty and improving people\u00d5s lives. The availability and accessibility of information promotes transparency, ensures better governance and reduces inefficiency and corruption. Information gives people the opportunity to improve their own lives, participate in the decision-making processes that affect them, and hold their leaders to account.  In Bangladesh, local communities and activists are using the Right To Information Act to hold authorities accountable for creating a safe and sustainable environment.   The challenge Illegal encroachment into rivers and bodies of water by industry is a significant environmental problem in Bangladesh, leading to air, water and soil pollution. Industrial and medical waste is often dumped into bodies of water, threatening the health of surrounding communities.  Unregulated and illegal rice and wood husk mills pose a particular problem. According to Bangladeshi legislation, these mills should be sited away from inhabited areas due to the significant levels of pollution they emit. However, mills frequently flout environmental laws, leading to reported health problems in surrounding communities. Compounding this problem are endemic issues of corruption and a lack of transparency. The citizens of the Khulna district who live along the Rupsha River were particularly       concerned that the increasing incidence of health problems in their community was tied to the proliferation of these mills. Linking access to information to protection of the environment ARTICLE 19 has been working with people in Bangladesh to help them fight for better environmental protection. We have trained local communities to make use of the Right To Information Act. As a result, these communities, along with civil society and campaigners, are now asking the authorities what they are doing to implement national laws and create a safe and sustainable environment.  We have worked closely with people from across the country, including the vulnerable coastal districts of Bhola and Cox\u00d5s Bazar, the forested areas of Gazipur and Bagerhat, and the northern coastal areas of Khulna and Sathkhira. As the case of Masum Billah (told below) demonstrates, asserting their right to information has become a key tool in these communities\u00d5 ability to demand enforcement of environmental protection laws. The outcome: \u00d2A new tool for holding local government and authorities accountable\u00d3 Masum Billah is a community leader from the Khulna municipality. He has received training from ARTICLE 19 in how to use the Right To Information Act in Bangladesh. As a result, he has BANGLADESH  Right to information + environment   held discussions with the Khulna Development Authority (KDA) and the Department of Environment about the state\u00d5s obligations under Bangladesh\u00d5s Right To Information Act 2009.  Local communities along the Rupsha River approached Masum, concerned that rice and wood husk mills were being established within the KDA without the necessary clearances. This was in violation of environmental laws and was having a negative impact on their health. Masum filed an application with the Department of Environment asking for disclosure of a full list of mills and factories with and without clearance. The results revealed that half were operating without the proper clearance, leading to an increased risk of environmental pollution and threatening the health of the local inhabitants. Masum Billah\u00d5s organisation, Social and Environment Movement (SEIAM), is now taking legal action against the Department of Environment and KDA, and campaigning for the removal of the illegally established mills. \u00d2ARTICLE 19 has introduced me to a new tool for holding local government and authorities accountable to their responsibilities for protecting the environment and for greater disclosure.\u00d3 -Masum Billah, Community leader in the Khulna municipality.      United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)     www.un-ngls.org    Policy Brief #7     Page 1 of 6   Policy Brief #7  Recommendations on Women\u2122s Human Rights and Gender Equality  for the UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (OWG on SDGs)  Additional policy briefs are available at http://bit.ly/OWGpolicybriefs    The recommendations on women\u2122s human rights and gender equality presented here have been compiled from two civil society consultations conducted by UN-NGLS in 2013: a teleconference-based consultation that resulted in the report Advancing Regional Recommendations on the Post-2015 Agenda, and an online consultation on four post-2015 reports to the Secretary-General. A list of organizations that participated in these consultations is available here. This policy brief also draws on the December 2013-January 2014 online consultation orchestrated by the Addressing Inequalities Networked Alliance (AINA) and co-moderated by UN-NGLS on the issues brief \ufb01Promoting Equality, including Social Equity\ufb02 produced by the UN inter-agency Technical Support Team for the OWG on SDGs. While presenting a wide range of views, this brief does not intend to represent the complete breadth of perspectives and recommendations emerging from civil society on the issues of women\u2122s \nhuman rights and gender equality for the post-2015 development agenda.  Civil society networks advocated for a universal, interlinked, multi-sectoral, and holistic approach to the SDGs that upholds the achievement of women\u2122s human rights and gender equality as central to the achievement of sustainable development. Contributors issued a resounding call for both a standalone goal on gender equality and women\u2122s human rights and the \ufb01mainstreaming\ufb02 of gender equality and women\u2122s human rights through comprehensive targets and indicators in the SDGs. Recognizing that women from socially excluded communities face multiple forms of discrimination, the SDGs must include a strong focus on the achievement of equity and social justice.   The process of developing the post-2015 agenda presents an opportunity to rethink the prevailing development model: several networks emphasized the need for the SDGs to stimulate profound and transformational change to the structures and systems that govern the lives of women and men. \nContributors underscored that gender-equitable sustainable development cannot be achieved under the prevailing neo-liberal economic model; therefore, this brief begins with civil society recommendations on macroeconomic policy and the structural shifts necessary to set the conditions for gender equality and the fulfillment of women\u2122s human rights. These recommendations call particular attention to the negative effects on women of fiscal cuts, including recent austerity measures, and inequitable trade policies. They also emphasize the need to transform the global economic system, particularly through reforming international financial institutions, trade and investment policies, and the governance of global supply chains. The post-2015 agenda must create policy space for equitable development, contributors stressed, and must require States to fulfill their   United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)     www.un-ngls.org    Policy Brief #7     Page 2 of 6 obligations to develop fiscal, trade, and monetary policies that support, rather than undermine, women\u2122s rights.   Contributors emphasized the importance of a rights-based approach to achieving gender equality, integrating the broader human rights framework into the post-2015 agenda and guaranteeing the full implementation of existing human rights agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its optional protocol; the Beijing Platform for Action; the Cairo Programme of Action; the Millennium Declaration; the outcome of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (\ufb01Rio+20\ufb02); and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women. State and non-state actors, including international financial institutions, must respect the fundamental human rights principles of universality, indivisibility, interdependence, participation, accountability, equality and non-discrimination. States must ensure the progressive realization of human rights for all by using the maximum of their available resources. The post-2015 agenda must recognize women as full rights holders, and integrate a comprehensive strategy with robust accountability mechanisms to fulfil women\u2122s economic, social, and cultural rights on par with civil and political rights. It is critical that States fulfil women\u2122s right to participate meaningfully in formulating, implementing, and monitoring the post-2015 agenda, in part by resourcing women\u2122s organizations and feminist movements.  Detailed recommendations are presented below, organized according to the following six objectives: 1. Reform macroeconomic policy to ensure gender equality and the fulfilment of human rights; 2. Promote women\u2122s access to decent work and social protection, and address unpaid care work; 3. Eliminate gender-based violence and discrimination; 4. Ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights; 5. Ensure gender-equitable distribution and safe use of natural resources; 6. Address the gendered nature of armed conflict, peace-making, and transitions to peace.  1. Reform Macroeconomic Policy to Ensure Gender Equality and Fulfil Human Rights  a) Bring all macroeconomic policies and practices in compliance with human rights obligations, including government revenue and expenditure, development assistance, debt and deficit financing, monetary policy and financial regulation, industrial policy, and trade architecture. Ensure that all States invest in effective, appropriate, and consistent policies and programmes for the achievement of gender equality, women\u2122s human rights, and women\u2122s empowerment. b) Reform international, regional, and domestic trade and financial systems to eliminate structural drivers of inequality and foster social norms that prioritize equality and equity. c) Ensure synergies between macroeconomic and social policies to contribute to mobilizing resources for economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, and to support equality along the lines of socioeconomic status, race, caste, and ethnicity as well as gender. Identify and eliminate gender biases in the formulation of policy, and collect and publish data disaggregated by sex as part of a comprehensive diversity of categories.  d) Create transparent mechanisms to regulate foreign direct investment and multinational corporations to ensure that the economic and financial interests of these actors do not undermine or conflict with the public interest, people\u2122s rights to socioeconomic security and decent livelihoods, or respect for human rights and sustainable development.    United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)     www.un-ngls.org    Policy Brief #7     Page 3 of 6 e) Promote policies and programmes to redistribute income, wealth, and assets to counter the negative effects of unequal distribution of resources and power within and between countries. f) Recognize and value unpaid care work when formulating and evaluating macroeconomic policies and development strategies.  g) Employ the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations as the foundation for facilitating good economic governance.   2. Promote Women\u2122s Access to Decent Work and Social Protection, and Address Unpaid Care Work  a) Enact policies to overcome women\u2122s unequal access to economic livelihood opportunities and formal employment, including by: promoting equal pay for equal work; ensuring freedom from discrimination; combatting gendered labour market segregation; shifting tax structures; providing incentives for employers; enforcing labour rights; improving the quality of employment; reducing the volatility of earnings; prohibiting sexual harassment; valuing and \nredistributing unpaid work; and ensuring full employment, decent work, and a living wage for all.  b) Implement universal social protection worldwide in the form of a basic income for all women and men, and access to services such as healthcare, food, water, energy, housing, and employment.  c) Implement supportive labour policies, including minimum wage policies, regulations on work hours, and protection for trade union and collective bargaining rights, particularly for women. d) Measure and recognize the value of unpaid labour through statistics and analysis and as a criterion for evaluating economic policy; reinforce State responsibilities to invest in social services including childcare, elder care, and healthcare to reduce the burden of care work on women; and promote the redistribution and equal sharing of unpaid labour through government incentives, labour laws and regulations, equality legislation, etc. Institute and measure work/family policies and equal maternity and paternity leave benefits, and promote the transformation of patriarchal social norms and stereotypes that constitute men as \ufb01breadwinners\ufb02 and women as \ufb01care-givers.\ufb02  3. Ensure Gender-Equitable Distribution and Safe Use of Natural Resources  a) Protect the equal rights of women to use and own land and access rivers, lakes, and seas to help ensure food sovereignty, health, nutrition security, and economic autonomy. Implement legally binding safeguards against land- and resource-grabbing, and ensure land reform is gender-equitable and in line with human rights principles and standards.1 Promote equal distribution of land and resources amongst women and men; prioritize the rights of people over corporations regarding land and other resources. b) Halt the commodification of nature and the dispossession of Indigenous and rural peoples. Manage natural resources in the interest of nature and of people, especially women; eliminate the use of harmful technologies and genetically modified organisms, and institute mechanisms for technology assessment, particularly in relation to technology transfer. c) Recognize and fully respect the unique knowledge of Indigenous peoples and peasant and coastal communities, especially the traditional knowledge held by women, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.                                                         1 In their contribution to the UN-NGLS online consultation, Landesa explained: \ufb01For women in particular, secure rights to land and other resources enhance their rights to self-determination and support their well-being, as well as that of their families and communities.  Thus, targets to increase the number of women and men with secure rights to land \u0152 and to ensure that women realize these rights on an equal basis with men \u0152 can help achieve multiple development goals in a post-2015 world.\ufb02    United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)     www.un-ngls.org    Policy Brief #7     Page 4 of 6 d) Acknowledge that climate change disproportionately impacts women and girls, and compounds impoverishment; strengthen resilience through community-driven, human rights-based, and feminist policies. Design and implement effective rights-based, socially just, gender-responsive and coherent ecosystem-based approaches to halt climate change. Encourage sustainable agricultural practices to help protect smallholder farmers (often women) and provide for climate change mitigation. Recognize women\u2122s roles and support gender-sensitive policies toward food sovereignty and in climate change mitigation and adaptation. e) Ensure that women and girls have access to safe, clean and renewable energy in their households and for their enterprises. Ensure women\u2122s access to all resources essential to livelihoods, e.g. seeds, water, sanitation, and hygiene.  4. Eliminate Gender-Based Discrimination and Violence   a) Eliminate structural barriers to gender equality, taking into account the various roles and vulnerabilities of women and their level of influence at individual, household, community, national, and global levels.  b) Enact and enforce laws and policies that contribute to achieving gender equality and women's human rights, particularly in marginalized communities; eliminate laws, policies, and practices, including early and forced marriages, that are harmful to women, girls, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) people.  c) Ensure the full and equal participation of women in all public and private decision-making, including the economic, legal, social, and political life of their communities, and control over finances and resources. Take temporary special measures2 to secure equality of outcomes that address both the public and private spheres of women\u2122s lives. Build affirmative action policies to ensure women from excluded communities can participate in political leadership and governance. d) Ensure women\u2122s access to productive resources, such as credit, infrastructure, skills, and technology, particularly through public investment in these areas.   e) Take long-term integrated action, including non-sexist and anti-discriminatory education, to transform stereotypes and norms based on gender and other axes of social exclusion including age, caste, ethnicity, and disability; expand the use of tools to assess gender equality and empowerment. Conduct intersectional analysis and appropriate interventions to address multiple forms of discrimination. f) Enact national legislation to ensure the human rights of LGBTQI people, and eliminate discrimination against them, including in access to healthcare, education, and justice. Promote changes to attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that perpetuate and foster discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity expression. Require States to report to the UN regarding their efforts to protect the human rights of, and ensure equality for, LGBTQI people. g) Combat all forms of gender-based violence, through zero tolerance targets and by enacting and enforcing laws. Include indicators that measure the reduction of violence against women and girls, along with indicators that measure perceptions of safety. Require States to report on their programmes to eliminate violence against women and girls on a regular basis. Implement                                                         2 CEDAW General recommendation No. 25, on article 4, paragraph 1 explains temporary special measures as directed \ufb01to accelerate the improvement of the position of women to achieve their de facto or substantive equality with men, and to effect the structural, social and cultural changes necessary to correct past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women, as well as to provide them with compensation. These measures are of a temporary nature.\ufb02   United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)     www.un-ngls.org    Policy Brief #7     Page 5 of 6 security sector reforms that prevent, respond to, and end impunity for violence against women, girls, and LGBTQI people; protect and support survivors of violence; prosecute and punish perpetrators; and provide gender-sensitive remedies. Recognize the particular risks and situations of socially excluded communities and women\u2122s human rights defenders and develop effective and gender-sensitive responses to violence against them. Commit to ending all violence on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Prohibit and take action to eliminate harmful practices, including customary practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of any sexual orientation or gender identity.    5. Ensure Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights  a) Eliminate inequalities in access to health services (particularly by wealth quintile, age, sex, geographical location, sexual orientation and gender identity, caste, ethnicity, ability, nationality, health, or legal or other status); address the inter-linkages between health (including sexual and reproductive health and rights) and inequality, and between ill-health and its impact on all other aspects of development, such as employment and education. b) As part of guaranteed universal healthcare, ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights for all, particularly for girls and women,3 including through the provision of quality, comprehensive, integrated and non-discriminatory sexual and reproductive health services in various locations and situations including emergencies. Such services should bear in mind the specific needs of men and women, adolescents and young people, persons of diverse sexuality and gender \nidentities, and persons with disabilities.  c) Guarantee universal and equitable access to: comprehensive sexuality education; safe, effective, affordable methods of contraception; safe and adequate maternity care; safe abortion; and prevention and treatment options for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. d) Ensure women and girls are free to decide on all matters of their sexuality and the number and spacing of their pregnancies, without coercion, discrimination, or violence. Eliminate legal and policy barriers (e.g. parental and spousal consent laws and laws that criminalize sexuality) to women\u2122s and girls\u2122 ability to access their sexual and reproductive rights, and thereby enable their full and equal participation in education, employment, and decision- and policy-making. Promote policies that enable people to exercise their sexual rights and their right to take free, informed, voluntary, and responsible decisions on their sexuality. Invest sufficient resources to provide universal sexual and reproductive healthcare. e) Make sexual and reproductive health services and comprehensive sexuality education youth-friendly and available to young people in and out of schools.  f) Promote the prevention and timely detection of HIV/AIDS, particularly through: accelerated action to ensure universal access to comprehensive treatment; increased investment in prevention; and addressing the intersections between violence and HIV. Health services must enable women living with HIV to receive non-discriminatory health care to make informed, autonomous choices about their sexual and reproductive rights, including during pregnancy and their future fertility to ensure it is free from coercion. g) Ensure the provision of sexual and reproductive health services and psychosocial care in conflict/post-conflict situations and humanitarian crises, particularly for survivors of sexual violence and refugees or internally displaced persons.                                                           3 In their contribution to the UN-NGLS online consultation, CHOICE for Youth and Sexuality recommended the incorporation of sexual and reproductive health and rights into the SDGs as a standalone goal.

Address the Gendered Nature of Armed Conflict, Peace-Making, and Transitions to Peace  a) Adopt holistic measures to ensure peace and security for people in general, and women in particular, including through women\u2122s participation in peace-making and security practice and through comprehensive strategies aimed at recognizing, including, and enhancing women\u2122s capacities and potential, as well as the structures and relations that discriminate against and constrain them from assuming a full and equal role in society. b) Integrate the Women, Peace, and Security agenda of the UN Security Council into the post-2015 framework through a holistic approach that addresses participation, prevention, and protection, as well as relief and recovery. c) Recognize that the effects of militarism, militarization, military spending, and the arms trade (e.g. small arms and light weapons, and particularly nuclear weapons) erode gender equality, increase violence and impunity, and impede the realization of women\u2122s rights.  d) Require States to demilitarize and to shift resources away from military spending towards investments in social equality and sustainable development. e) Hold States accountable for the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict situations and ensure that gender based crimes against humanity are not granted amnesty during peace processes; commit funds for in country monitoring of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1325, 1820, 1888, 1889, 1960, 2106, and 2122.   1   Save the  Submission to the Sixth Session of the General Assembly  Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals: 9-13 December 2013  SUMMARY  Save the Children promotes a holistic post-2015 development agenda that has poverty eradication at its core and is guided by universal, equitable and human rights-based approaches to sustainable development. This briefing highlights key recommendations on global partnerships for achieving sustainable development, means of implementation, needs of countries in special situations, human rights, the right to development and global governance, which are priority issues for Save the Children. The following recommendations are based on the 10-goal framework proposed in our Ending Poverty In Our Generation report.   GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Proposed goals and targets for a global partnership for development:  Goal Targets By 2030 we will have robust global partnerships for more and effective use of financial resources 1. Increased and more effective use of resources for development 2. International transparency to support domestic resource mobilization 3. Establish and enforce intellectual property rights that work for development   1. Financing for Sustainable Development  While much development is about action within developing countries, there are also crucial ways in which the global community can contribute to positive development outcomes, including through financing for development. Low-income countries, by definition, are working with an income of less than about $1,000 per person per year, which generates massive challenges of a type largely forgotten in developed countries.   Despite increases in aid, in other ways, richer countries have not played their part. International finance for development is no longer solely about developed countries giving aid to developing countries and increasingly, other types of financial flows are gaining importance.1 If we are to make a new global partnership more sustainable and accountable than MDG 8, we must consider diverse means of financing the goals of a future framework as well as how such financing will be tracked and monitored.   A post-2015 sustainable development framework must be underpinned by a robust financing plan, with detailed financing strategies developed in every country context. National financing plans should identify potential sources of funding for planned, costed progress on each goal; these are likely to include a mix of taxation, stable foreign and domestic private investment, private philanthropic flows and ODA. As well as identifying finance sources, the strategy should consider the equitable distribution of those resources and other proposed policy changes to support the strategy, such as an inclusive growth strategy or a proposed strengthening of transfer pricing rules and enhancing transparency and accountability of development expenditure to citizens by moving  towards more open, accountable and inclusive governance.  The continued importance of ODA  At its best, aid comprises finance specifically targeted at improving human development outcomes.  Developed countries committed in the 1970s to give 0.7% of their gross national income as official development assistance (ODA). While a handful of countries have passed this target and a handful of others are on track to reach it soon, it is worrisome that                                                  1 A recent EURODAD paper provides a useful summary of all the financial resources potentially available for development, examines their key characteristics, and discusses their poverty and sustainable development impacts, and the implications for aid: http://eurodad.org/files/integration/2013/03/2013_AW-Briefing-paper_Global-financial-flows-aid-and-development1.pdf    2 many developed countries have not followed through on their commitment to reach 0.7%.2 It is vital that they do so as an urgent priority. In certain contexts, aid for human development is crucial, making up a quarter of the education budget in some low-income countries for example.3  The quality of aid is as important as its quantity. Ensuring quality is vital for making the most of the resources available. If all countries, and other donors, provided aid transparently, the gains in efficiency would be equivalent to an additional US$3 billion. Further, untying aid can increase its value by 1530%4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the role of the private sector   The potential impact of private sector investment in developing countries is increasing dramatically, and dwarfs in volume all other forms of economic engagement with developing countries. The rise in inward foreign direct investment to developing countries is well documented, increasing from US$3.8 billion in 1970 to US$684 billion in 2011.5 The fact that foreign direct investment accounts for approximately 10% of total investment (gross fixed capital formation) in middle and low-income countries over the last decade6 indicates the significance of domestic private sector investment  something that has often been overlooked in discussions of the role of business in development. In light of this reality and the growing impact of business on the delivery of development objectives, the engagement of the private sector in the conception and implementation of the post-2015 development framework is critical to its success.  The private sector, which comprises a huge range of domestic and multinational businesses, has an important contribution to make in the delivery of the next human development agenda. These include: stimulating inclusive growth and creating decent jobs; enhancing access to essential services; developing innovations to address human and sustainable development challenges; paying its fair share of taxes; providing expertise and resources to improve the lives of those most in need; and reducing its environmental footprint.  Three steps that businesses can take to ensure a more positive development impact, as partners in the delivery of the post-2015 development agenda, are:  i. disclosing social impacts of their products, such as breast milk substitutes); to practices (such as labour standards or tax strategies); and to indirect impacts (such as their environmental footprint); ii. Shaping core business strategies to contribute to development goals; and iii. Advocating for change at the national and global level.  While multi-stakeholder partnerships can make a huge impact, they must be sufficiently vetted and legitimate, be in the best interests of the poorest communities, and be sustainable.   Taxation and domestic revenue raising  In all countries, the bedrock of finance for development is taxation. Taxes are the largest, most sustainable and predictable source of finance for developing countries.7 Indeed, at the recent G8 Summit in June 2013 leaders recognized taxation as critical to effective, capable states and  to fairness and prosperity for 8 The importance of effective taxation is captured eloquently in the slogan of the Kenyan revenue authority; \"Pay Your Taxes, and Set Your Country Free.\" In spite of the recognition of the importance of taxation however, low-income countries currently collect an average of only 13% of their GDP in tax revenues, compared to 35% in OECD countries.9                                                  2 Aid Watch (2012) Aid We Can: Invest more in global development, Concord: Brussels 3 Save the Children and Overseas Development Institute (2012), Progress in Child Well-Being: Building on what works. 4 Save the Children: (2013) Ending Poverty In Our Generation, p. 22. 5 UNCTAD, Inward and Outward Foreign Direct Investment Flows (1970-2010). http://unctadstat.unctad.org/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=88 [Accessed 18/03/13]   6 ChartsBin website, based on UNCTAD World Investment Report, 26 July 2011. http://chartsbin.com/view/2272 [Accessed 28/02/13]   7 See for example: African Development Bank, OECD & UNECA, 2010: African Economic Outlook 2010. 8 Lough Erne G8  Communique 9 House of Commons, International Development Committee, Tax in Developing Countries: Increasing resources for development, fourth report of session 201213, 16 July 2012, p. 5.   3 Increasing domestic resource mobilisation has a multitude of benefits.10 It raises public revenue, helps generate a sense of citizenship and makes governments more accountable to their citizens so that revenues are likely to be better spent. If tax is raised progressively, it can tackle inequality directly. And a clampdown on tax evasion and avoidance helps to foster a sense of fairness, equality and good governance among citizens. The converse is also true - a loss of tax revenue and the associated services that are funded through taxation can weaken the confidence and trust citizens have in governments.   Countries should commit in the post-2015 development agenda to raise their tax-to-GDP ratio and must be supported with capacity building from development partners, including international financial institutions, to mobilise these additional revenues. Critically, revenue mobilisation must be pursued with equity as well as efficiency and the global partnership must support progressive taxation policies that tackle inequalities while mobilising revenues.  2. International transparency to support sustainable development   Taxation and global governance  While aid may be perceived as the most obvious type of finance for development by people living in rich countries, those same countries bear a large responsibility for the weaknesses of the international system that allows tax dodging and grand corruption. One estimate puts the potential benefit of challenging international tax abuse at a reduction in under-five mortality of 1,000 per day.11 Forthcoming Save the Children research in 2014 will demonstrate the role that taxation, and curbing illicit financial flows, must play in order to reach goals on several important development issues including child mortality, stunting, primary education, and universal access to water and sanitation.  This is not only a matter of good global governance, it also presents a financial opportunity, as better regulation of financial secrecy has the potential to dramatically increase the resources available for development. The OECD estimates that developing countries lose three times more to tax havens than they receive in aid each year. An international transparency commitment  in which countries provide information to each other about their  bank accounts, companies or other investments  would shine a powerful spotlight on illicit financial flows, and could encourage curbing the tax losses that are estimated to exceed aid receipts.  International aid transparency  Transparency is central to accountability and aid delivery.  The number of organisations and donors publishing their aid data transparently and to a common standard has increased substantially to 187 since 2011.12 All aid donors should release data to International Aid Transparency Initiative standards to better support sustainable development. The Global Partnership on Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) should be supported to continue the work on improving aid transparency and effectiveness, including that of South-South and triangular co-operation.  Data availability  A global partnership for improvements in the quality, availability and accessibility of data is urgently required to track progress towards post-2015 targets, support evidence-based policy making, and ensure that the poorest and most marginalized are being reached. Data that is currently available to measure different dimensions of poverty is woefully patchy, irregularly collected and often unreliable.13 Data must be collected under the post-2015 framework that is comparable across countries and based on common indicators, data collection standards and methodological approach. Improvements must be made in the coverage, quality, and regularity of data collection, as well as in the transparency and accessibility of data to citizens to enable them to hold leaders to account. Focus must be placed on data that can meaningfully assess progress in human wellbeing and on human development outcomes (e.g. learning outcomes in addition to school enrolment). Efforts should be focused on building statistical capacity at the national level whilst ensuring coordination and comparability at the international level.                                                   10 See discussion under   in Cobham, A (2012)  havens and illicit  pp.337372 in Reuter, P (ed.)

Metrics must capture imbalances in power and opportunity that exist within households as well as in the public realm.   There is an urgent need for action in this area; ensuring that baselines are established and systems are up and running in time will require substantial investment, institutional reform and capacity building.  3. Science and technology, knowledge-sharing and capacity building as means of implementation   Financing is, of course, not the only global resource for a shared partnership for development; others include inventiveness and technology. Trade agreements should maximise resources available for development, by facilitating a balance between the need to share know-how on crucial innovations underpinning development  such as information technology, nutritious products and drugs  and the need of originators to protect their intellectual property. In the health sector, for example, intellectual property rules should be implemented with full flexibility to ensure that low-income countries facing heath crises are able to license and procure alternative supplies of essential medicines, without infringing intellectual property rules in developed country markets.  NEEDS OF COUNTRIES IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS  Conflict-affected and fragile (CAF) states are likely to struggle the most to achieve ambitious goals and targets under the post-2015 framework. However, while CAF states are the furthest behind in multidimensional poverty reduction, they are also a group that holds huge potential for dramatic acceleration in rates of progress. Liberia is a case in point, having reduced child mortality rates from 241 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 78 in 201014.. Twenty CAF states have already met one or more of the MDG targets, with eight having halved extreme income poverty ahead of the 2015 deadline15.    The post-2015 development framework should provide the foundations for CAF states to be supported through partnership and development approaches that meet their particular needs, and that tackle the root causes of fragility. The framework should build on the 2011 Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals that were agreed in 2011 as part of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States16. These recognise the need for focus on the political, economic and social foundations that are preconditions for achieving the MDGs, and include fostering legitimate politics, strengthening security, advancing justice, building economic foundations for development and building capacity for accountable revenue management and service delivery. This underscores the importance of including a standalone goal on open, inclusive and transparent governance in the post-2015 framework. As major drivers of conflict and instability, economic, social and political inequalities must also be tackled through targets and indicators to track gaps and differential rates of progress between advantaged and disadvantaged groups.    HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE  Save the  proposed post-2015 development agenda champions universal and equitable development, with human rights as its guiding principle.  Human rights principles such as universality, equality and inalienability must underpin the future agenda and unlike the MDGs, these principles must be visible in the goals and targets established.   Although the MDGs are fundamentally concerned with realising  rights, they are not framed in the language of human rights. This has also attracted comment and some criticism. Most tangibly, the MDG targets to reach one-half or two-thirds of people fall short of many  pre-existing obligations under human rights conventions including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which enjoys near universal ratification. Accordingly, the new framework must reflect  right to a life free from poverty and contain ero  for human development to capture the human rights principle of universality and to ensure no one is left behind.                                                   14 Countdown to 2015 (2013) Accountability profile: Liberia.

It was presented and widely endorsed at the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan in 2011, and comprises the five Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals, and principles for putting countries in the lead of their own pathways out of fragility.  For more information see http://www.newdeal4peace.org/new-deal-snapshot/   5  Save the  post-2015 development agenda includes a number of specific human rights that were neglected in the MDGs under proposed goals on child protection and more open, accountable and inclusive governance.   Child protection   Every child has the human right to freedom from all forms of violence, whether perpetrated by public officials or private individuals. Nevertheless, for millions of children, abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence takes place on a daily basis  at home, at school, in institutions, at work and in the community. The root causes of violence against children are very similar across countries, culture, traditions and level of income. These include social acceptance of some forms of violence (such as harmful traditional practices and corporal punishment), discrimination (based on gender, disability, sexual identity, ethnicity, religion etc) and power relationship between gender and ages.   Proposed goals and targets to ensure the protection of children:  Goal  Targets By 2030 we will ensure all children live a life free from all forms of violence, are protected in conflict and thrive in a safe family environment 1. End the child deaths from armed conflict; halve the number of non-conflict violent deaths of children 2. Halve the number of children who are subject to sexual violence and abuse of any form 3. Halve the number of children subjected to violent discipline at home 4. Halve the number of children unnecessarily living outside family care (including children affected by emergencies)  The full scale of violence and abuse of children is unknown, as much of it goes unreported. But the figures below give an indication of the enormous magnitude of the situation  a crisis of child protection that is different in nature but not in fundamentals between the developed and developing world.  Global statistics on violence against children include:   Between 500 million and 1.5 billion children experience violence annually17.   About 20 % of women and 5-10 % of men suffered sexual abuse as children18.   3 out of every 4 children experience violent discipline at home19.   85 million children -55 million boys and 30 million girls - are involved in the worst forms of child labour20.   3 million girls and women in Sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and Sudan suffer female genital mutilation every year21.   Over 2 million children around the world live in care institutions22.  At least 80% of these have one or both parents who are alive23.   Just over 1 billion children live in countries or territories affected by armed conflict24.  Around the world, thousands of boys and girls are recruited into government armed forces and rebel groups to serve as combatants, cooks, porters, messengers or in other roles25.  Open, accountable and inclusive governance   A system of open, accountable and inclusive governance where information about policy-making and budgeting is available to the public in a timely and accessible format, where the public has the freedom and power to engage in policy-                                                 17 United Nations  Fund,  Progress on Major Conventions, Declarations and Plans for  and  Study on Violence against Children: What are the limitations of the existing data and how can they be  UNICEF, New York, October 2006 (internal documents) quoted in UNICEF, Progress for Children, A Report Card on Child Protection, September 2009, p. 7 18 WHO Fact sheet, Child abuse and neglect, 2002, http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/childabusefacts.pdf 19 Estimates based on data from 33 low and middle-income countries, covering around 10% of the  population.

Proposed goals and targets on governance  Goal  Targets By 2030 governance will be more open, accountable and inclusive 1. Ensure all countries have transparent governance, with open budgeting, freedom of information and holistic corporate reporting 2. Ensure all countries have participatory governance, with greater freedom of speech, press and political choice 3. Ensure all countries have accountable governance, with commitment to the rule of law, more equitable and effective public services, and reduced corruption  The importance of these issues is evidenced by the UNDG consultations involving more than a million people around the world, which found that one of the three top priorities for citizens was  honest and responsive  Further, Rio+20 affirms that effective governance at local, sub-national, national, regional and global levels representing the voices and interests of all is critical for advancing sustainable development.  Recent research from Save the Children also shows that certain dimension of poverty could be eradicated by 2030 if governments address income inequality and improve governance. For example, improvements in access to and utilization of services and opportunities that could be brought about by reducing inequality and improving voice and accountability could save 1.8 million lives, and bring global average mortality down to around 20 deaths per 1.000 live births.26  All countries  from the most fragile and conflict-affected to those with the most long-standing traditions of democracy  can make improvements in measures of transparency, participation and accountability. To recognise the importance of open governments in and of itself and also for sustainable reductions in absolute poverty, several facets of open, accountable and inclusive governance should be included in the post-2015 framework.  Global governance  The MDG framework lacks a robust, effective accountability mechanism, making it difficult to ensure the fulfillment of commitments in a transparent way. This in turn has meant that progress is inconsistent. For countries where there is strong political will, resources are put in place to ensure implementation, but countries that lack it are not adequately held to account.   To improve the incentive to implement the post-2015 development framework, it needs to be accompanied by a formal global accountability and reporting mechanism, which provides a channel for accountability at local, national and global levels. This mechanism will likely be through the High Level Political Forum (HLPF). It will be critical to the success of the HLPF that accountability is facilitated not just between governments, but between citizens and their governments at local and national level, and other development partners, including the private sector.   It would also be important that this global accountability and reporting mechanism is drawing lessons from and operating in synergy with existing accountability mechanisms. These include the UN Human Rights Council mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) - where the human rights records of all UN Member States are peer-reviewed - special procedures and working groups; and the UN treaty bodies mandated to oversee implementation of the UN human rights treaties, such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child which oversees the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its three Optional Protocols. Regional mechanisms mandated to promote and monitor  rights, such as the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, would also be important in this context.   There is a further challenge: accountability is based on information about progress. Data collection systems in many key areas are weak or simply absent in many countries, making it very difficult to assess progress. Access to information to enable more informed public participation and meaningful accountability are inextricably linked, and better data, transparently and timely available, needs to be a high global priority to support accountability.                                                  26 Save the Children (2013), Getting to Zero  How we can be the generation that ends poverty   1   Save the  Submission to the Sixth Session of the General Assembly  Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals: 9-13 December 2013  SUMMARY  Save the Children promotes a holistic post-2015 development agenda that has poverty eradication at its core and is guided by universal, equitable and human rights-based approaches to sustainable development.

The private sector, which comprises a huge range of domestic and multinational businesses, has an important contribution to make in the delivery of the next human development agenda. These include: stimulating inclusive growth and creating decent jobs; enhancing access to essential services; developing innovations to address human and sustainable development challenges; paying its fair share of taxes; providing expertise and resources to improve the lives of those most in need; and reducing its environmental footprint.  Three steps that businesses can take to ensure a more positive development impact, as partners in the delivery of the post-2015 development agenda, are:  i. disclosing social impacts of their products, such as breast milk substitutes); to practices (such as labour standards or tax strategies); and to indirect impacts (such as their environmental footprint); ii. Shaping core business strategies to contribute to development goals; and iii. Advocating for change at the national and global level.  While multi-stakeholder partnerships can make a huge impact, they must be sufficiently vetted and legitimate, be in the best interests of the poorest communities, and be sustainable.   Taxation and domestic revenue raising  In all countries, the bedrock of finance for development is taxation. Taxes are the largest, most sustainable and predictable source of finance for developing countries.7 Indeed, at the recent G8 Summit in June 2013 leaders recognized taxation as critical to effective, capable states and  to fairness and prosperity for 8 The importance of effective taxation is captured eloquently in the slogan of the Kenyan revenue authority; \"Pay Your Taxes, and Set Your Country Free.\" In spite of the recognition of the importance of taxation however, low-income countries currently collect an average of only 13% of their GDP in tax revenues, compared to 35% in OECD countries.9                                                  2 Aid Watch (2012) Aid We Can: Invest more in global development, Concord: Brussels 3 Save the Children and Overseas Development Institute (2012), Progress in Child Well-Being: Building on what works. 4 Save the Children: (2013) Ending Poverty In Our Generation, p. 22. 5 UNCTAD, Inward and Outward Foreign Direct Investment Flows (1970-2010). http://unctadstat.unctad.org/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=88 [Accessed 18/03/13]   6 ChartsBin website, based on UNCTAD World Investment Report, 26 July 2011. http://chartsbin.com/view/2272 [Accessed 28/02/13]   7 See for example: African Development Bank, OECD & UNECA, 2010: African Economic Outlook 2010. 8 Lough Erne G8  Communique 9 House of Commons, International Development Committee, Tax in Developing Countries: Increasing resources for development, fourth report of session 201213, 16 July 2012, p. 5.   3 Increasing domestic resource mobilisation has a multitude of benefits.10 It raises public revenue, helps generate a sense of citizenship and makes governments more accountable to their citizens so that revenues are likely to be better spent. If tax is raised progressively, it can tackle inequality directly. And a clampdown on tax evasion and avoidance helps to foster a sense of fairness, equality and good governance among citizens. The converse is also true - a loss of tax revenue and the associated services that are funded through taxation can weaken the confidence and trust citizens have in governments.   Countries should commit in the post-2015 development agenda to raise their tax-to-GDP ratio and must be supported with capacity building from development partners, including international financial institutions, to mobilise these additional revenues. Critically, revenue mobilisation must be pursued with equity as well as efficiency and the global partnership must support progressive taxation policies that tackle inequalities while mobilising revenues.  2. International transparency to support sustainable development   Taxation and global governance  While aid may be perceived as the most obvious type of finance for development by people living in rich countries, those same countries bear a large responsibility for the weaknesses of the international system that allows tax dodging and grand corruption. One estimate puts the potential benefit of challenging international tax abuse at a reduction in under-five mortality of 1,000 per day.11 Forthcoming Save the Children research in 2014 will demonstrate the role that taxation, and curbing illicit financial flows, must play in order to reach goals on several important development issues including child mortality, stunting, primary education, and universal access to water and sanitation.  This is not only a matter of good global governance, it also presents a financial opportunity, as better regulation of financial secrecy has the potential to dramatically increase the resources available for development. The OECD estimates that developing countries lose three times more to tax havens than they receive in aid each year. An international transparency commitment  in which countries provide information to each other about their  bank accounts, companies or other investments  would shine a powerful spotlight on illicit financial flows, and could encourage curbing the tax losses that are estimated to exceed aid receipts.  International aid transparency  Transparency is central to accountability and aid delivery.  The number of organisations and donors publishing their aid data transparently and to a common standard has increased substantially to 187 since 2011.12 All aid donors should release data to International Aid Transparency Initiative standards to better support sustainable development. The Global Partnership on Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) should be supported to continue the work on improving aid transparency and effectiveness, including that of South-South and triangular co-operation.  Data availability  A global partnership for improvements in the quality, availability and accessibility of data is urgently required to track progress towards post-2015 targets, support evidence-based policy making, and ensure that the poorest and most marginalized are being reached. Data that is currently available to measure different dimensions of poverty is woefully patchy, irregularly collected and often unreliable.13 Data must be collected under the post-2015 framework that is comparable across countries and based on common indicators, data collection standards and methodological approach. Improvements must be made in the coverage, quality, and regularity of data collection, as well as in the transparency and accessibility of data to citizens to enable them to hold leaders to account. Focus must be placed on data that can meaningfully assess progress in human wellbeing and on human development outcomes (e.g. learning outcomes in addition to school enrolment). Efforts should be focused on building statistical capacity at the national level whilst ensuring coordination and comparability at the international level.                                                   10 See discussion under   in Cobham, A (2012)  havens and illicit  pp.337372 in Reuter, P (ed.)

Metrics must capture imbalances in power and opportunity that exist within households as well as in the public realm.   There is an urgent need for action in this area; ensuring that baselines are established and systems are up and running in time will require substantial investment, institutional reform and capacity building.  3. Science and technology, knowledge-sharing and capacity building as means of implementation   Financing is, of course, not the only global resource for a shared partnership for development; others include inventiveness and technology. Trade agreements should maximise resources available for development, by facilitating a balance between the need to share know-how on crucial innovations underpinning development  such as information technology, nutritious products and drugs  and the need of originators to protect their intellectual property. In the health sector, for example, intellectual property rules should be implemented with full flexibility to ensure that low-income countries facing heath crises are able to license and procure alternative supplies of essential medicines, without infringing intellectual property rules in developed country markets.  NEEDS OF COUNTRIES IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS  Conflict-affected and fragile (CAF) states are likely to struggle the most to achieve ambitious goals and targets under the post-2015 framework. However, while CAF states are the furthest behind in multidimensional poverty reduction, they are also a group that holds huge potential for dramatic acceleration in rates of progress. Liberia is a case in point, having reduced child mortality rates from 241 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 78 in 201014.. Twenty CAF states have already met one or more of the MDG targets, with eight having halved extreme income poverty ahead of the 2015 deadline15.    The post-2015 development framework should provide the foundations for CAF states to be supported through partnership and development approaches that meet their particular needs, and that tackle the root causes of fragility. The framework should build on the 2011 Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals that were agreed in 2011 as part of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States16. These recognise the need for focus on the political, economic and social foundations that are preconditions for achieving the MDGs, and include fostering legitimate politics, strengthening security, advancing justice, building economic foundations for development and building capacity for accountable revenue management and service delivery. This underscores the importance of including a standalone goal on open, inclusive and transparent governance in the post-2015 framework. As major drivers of conflict and instability, economic, social and political inequalities must also be tackled through targets and indicators to track gaps and differential rates of progress between advantaged and disadvantaged groups.    HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE  Save the  proposed post-2015 development agenda champions universal and equitable development, with human rights as its guiding principle.  Human rights principles such as universality, equality and inalienability must underpin the future agenda and unlike the MDGs, these principles must be visible in the goals and targets established.   Although the MDGs are fundamentally concerned with realising  rights, they are not framed in the language of human rights. This has also attracted comment and some criticism. Most tangibly, the MDG targets to reach one-half or two-thirds of people fall short of many  pre-existing obligations under human rights conventions including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which enjoys near universal ratification. Accordingly, the new framework must reflect  right to a life free from poverty and contain ero  for human development to capture the human rights principle of universality and to ensure no one is left behind.                                                   14 Countdown to 2015 (2013) Accountability profile: Liberia.

It was presented and widely endorsed at the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan in 2011, and comprises the five Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals, and principles for putting countries in the lead of their own pathways out of fragility.  For more information see http://www.newdeal4peace.org/new-deal-snapshot/   5  Save the  post-2015 development agenda includes a number of specific human rights that were neglected in the MDGs under proposed goals on child protection and more open, accountable and inclusive governance.   Child protection   Every child has the human right to freedom from all forms of violence, whether perpetrated by public officials or private individuals. Nevertheless, for millions of children, abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence takes place on a daily basis  at home, at school, in institutions, at work and in the community. The root causes of violence against children are very similar across countries, culture, traditions and level of income. These include social acceptance of some forms of violence (such as harmful traditional practices and corporal punishment), discrimination (based on gender, disability, sexual identity, ethnicity, religion etc) and power relationship between gender and ages.   Proposed goals and targets to ensure the protection of children:  Goal  Targets By 2030 we will ensure all children live a life free from all forms of violence, are protected in conflict and thrive in a safe family environment 1. End the child deaths from armed conflict; halve the number of non-conflict violent deaths of children 2. Halve the number of children who are subject to sexual violence and abuse of any form 3. Halve the number of children subjected to violent discipline at home 4. Halve the number of children unnecessarily living outside family care (including children affected by emergencies)  The full scale of violence and abuse of children is unknown, as much of it goes unreported. But the figures below give an indication of the enormous magnitude of the situation  a crisis of child protection that is different in nature but not in fundamentals between the developed and developing world.  Global statistics on violence against children include:   Between 500 million and 1.5 billion children experience violence annually17.   About 20 % of women and 5-10 % of men suffered sexual abuse as children18.   3 out of every 4 children experience violent discipline at home19.   85 million children -55 million boys and 30 million girls - are involved in the worst forms of child labour20.   3 million girls and women in Sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and Sudan suffer female genital mutilation every year21.   Over 2 million children around the world live in care institutions22.  At least 80% of these have one or both parents who are alive23.   Just over 1 billion children live in countries or territories affected by armed conflict24.  Around the world, thousands of boys and girls are recruited into government armed forces and rebel groups to serve as combatants, cooks, porters, messengers or in other roles25.  Open, accountable and inclusive governance   A system of open, accountable and inclusive governance where information about policy-making and budgeting is available to the public in a timely and accessible format, where the public has the freedom and power to engage in policy-                                                 17 United Nations  Fund,  Progress on Major Conventions, Declarations and Plans for  and  Study on Violence against Children: What are the limitations of the existing data and how can they be  UNICEF, New York, October 2006 (internal documents) quoted in UNICEF, Progress for Children, A Report Card on Child Protection, September 2009, p. 7 18 WHO Fact sheet, Child abuse and neglect, 2002, http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/childabusefacts.pdf 19 Estimates based on data from 33 low and middle-income countries, covering around 10% of the  population.

Proposed goals and targets on governance  Goal  Targets By 2030 governance will be more open, accountable and inclusive 1. Ensure all countries have transparent governance, with open budgeting, freedom of information and holistic corporate reporting 2. Ensure all countries have participatory governance, with greater freedom of speech, press and political choice 3. Ensure all countries have accountable governance, with commitment to the rule of law, more equitable and effective public services, and reduced corruption  The importance of these issues is evidenced by the UNDG consultations involving more than a million people around the world, which found that one of the three top priorities for citizens was  honest and responsive  Further, Rio+20 affirms that effective governance at local, sub-national, national, regional and global levels representing the voices and interests of all is critical for advancing sustainable development.  Recent research from Save the Children also shows that certain dimension of poverty could be eradicated by 2030 if governments address income inequality and improve governance. For example, improvements in access to and utilization of services and opportunities that could be brought about by reducing inequality and improving voice and accountability could save 1.8 million lives, and bring global average mortality down to around 20 deaths per 1.000 live births.26  All countries  from the most fragile and conflict-affected to those with the most long-standing traditions of democracy  can make improvements in measures of transparency, participation and accountability. To recognise the importance of open governments in and of itself and also for sustainable reductions in absolute poverty, several facets of open, accountable and inclusive governance should be included in the post-2015 framework.  Global governance  The MDG framework lacks a robust, effective accountability mechanism, making it difficult to ensure the fulfillment of commitments in a transparent way. This in turn has meant that progress is inconsistent. For countries where there is strong political will, resources are put in place to ensure implementation, but countries that lack it are not adequately held to account.   To improve the incentive to implement the post-2015 development framework, it needs to be accompanied by a formal global accountability and reporting mechanism, which provides a channel for accountability at local, national and global levels. This mechanism will likely be through the High Level Political Forum (HLPF). It will be critical to the success of the HLPF that accountability is facilitated not just between governments, but between citizens and their governments at local and national level, and other development partners, including the private sector.   It would also be important that this global accountability and reporting mechanism is drawing lessons from and operating in synergy with existing accountability mechanisms. These include the UN Human Rights Council mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) - where the human rights records of all UN Member States are peer-reviewed - special procedures and working groups; and the UN treaty bodies mandated to oversee implementation of the UN human rights treaties, such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child which oversees the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its three Optional Protocols. Regional mechanisms mandated to promote and monitor  rights, such as the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, would also be important in this context.   There is a further challenge: accountability is based on information about progress. Data collection systems in many key areas are weak or simply absent in many countries, making it very difficult to assess progress. Access to information to enable more informed public participation and meaningful accountability are inextricably linked, and better data, transparently and timely available, needs to be a high global priority to support accountability.                                                  26 Save the Children (2013), Getting to Zero  How we can be the generation that ends poverty   United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)         www.un-ngls.org         Policy Brief #4        Page 1 of 6    Policy Brief #4  Recommendations on Human Rights  for the UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  (OWG on SDGs)  Additional briefs are available at http://bit.ly/OWGpolicybriefs    The recommendations on human rights presented here have been compiled from two civil society consultations conducted by UN-NGLS in 2013: a teleconference-based consultation that resulted in the report Advancing Regional Recommendations on the Post-2015 Agenda and an online consultation on four post-2015 reports to the Secretary-General. A list of organizations that participated in these consultations is available here. This brief presents the most common themes that emerged from these consultations, along with a collection of specific recommendations articulated by participating organizations. It also includes elements from the \ufb01Human Rights for All Post-2015\ufb02 statement produced by the Human Rights Post-2015 Caucus, which UN-NGLS encourages readers to review in full. While presenting a wide range of views, this brief does not intend to represent the complete breadth of perspectives and recommendations emerging \nfrom the human rights advocacy community on the post-2015 development agenda.   Civil society networks insisted that to ensure a just, equitable, and sustainable world in which all people experience individual and collective well-being, the post-2015 development agenda must be fully aligned with the existing human rights framework and reflect its fundamental principles of universality, equality, and non-discrimination, as well as progressive realization and non-regression. Underpinning the framework with human rights would enable a move from a model of charity to one based on the inherent dignity of people as holders of human rights, with national governments as primary duty-bearers at national and international levels, and all development actors sharing common but differentiated responsibilities.1   Consultation participants underscored the need to ensure policy coherence between the post-2015 negotiations and existing international human rights agreements.2 Human rights are not moral aspirations;                                                  1 Human Rights Post-2015 Caucus, \ufb01Human Rights for All Post-2015\ufb02 (2013), page 1. 2 The following human rights agreements were referred to by consultation contributors:  Universal Declaration of Human Rights; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Convention on the Rights of the Child; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; Domestic Workers Convention; International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights; Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \ufb01Protect, Respect and Remedy\ufb02 Framework; Committee Against Torture, Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and its Committee on the Elimination on all Forms of Violence against Women; temporary special measures provided for in Article 4 of CEDAW Human Rights Committee; Beijing Platform for Action; International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and its Programme of Action; UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. In addition, other rights   United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS)         www.un-ngls.org         Policy Brief #4        Page 2 of 6  they are internationally agreed norms, standards and legal obligations that States must respect, protect, and fulfil. A human rights-based approach is essential to overcome growing inequalities, discriminatory practices, and unjust distributions of power that impede development progress. The new development agenda must prioritize measures to realize equality and equity, and accordingly must enable the full and meaningful participation of all stakeholders \u0152 particularly marginalized and disenfranchised groups \u0152 throughout all phases of policy-making, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. It is imperative to ensure genuine participation in decision-making at all levels, access to information, and consequential participation \u0152 with commitments to protect the freedoms of association, expression, assembly, and political participation.3  \nThe post-2015 agenda and all associated goals and targets must be people-centered and effectively address the numerous challenges that continue to prevent the fulfillment of human rights for many. It must also reinforce the duty of States to use the maximum of their available resources to realize these rights progressively for all. Focused support must be given to fulfilling the rights of vulnerable and marginalized people, particularly those who face intersecting inequalities based on gender, age, class, ethnicity, \nindigeneity, sexual orientation, gender identity, (dis)abilities, and/or status as a migrant, asylum-seeker or refugee, many of whom have been systematically, historically, and continually excluded.  While States at national and international levels must remain the primary duty-holders in development, all development actors \u0152 including third-party States, the private sector, and international institutions \u0152 should be made responsive and accountable for achieving - and not undermining - global goals. Therefore, civil society networks argued, the post-2015 framework must be crafted as a tool that empowers and enables people \u0152 individually and collectively \u0152 to monitor and hold their governments, other governments, businesses, international institutions, and other development actors to account for their conduct as it affects people\u2122s lives within and beyond borders. The framework must integrate meaningful institutions and systems to ensure human rights accountability of all development actors, incorporating citizen-led systems of monitoring and human rights accountability, with clear and time-bound commitments of all relevant actors.4   For a global development partnership to have real meaning, international post-2015 accountability mechanisms must not be limited to monitoring national outcomes and policy efforts. Constraints preventing countries from achieving their development commitments are often rooted in policy decisions taken by other States in their capacity as donors, trading partners, or members of inter-governmental institutions. The obligations of these States to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights beyond their borders must be included within the remit of global accountability mechanisms set up under the new \nframework. The degree to which States and their representation in international institutions are supporting or undermining the fulfillment of development and human rights commitments by third countries must therefore also be monitored.   \nAny post-2015 monitoring mechanism would benefit from constructive interaction with the existing human rights protection regime, as well as with other relevant accountability mechanisms. National mechanisms including judiciaries, parliaments, and national human rights institutions should be reinforced by regional and international human rights review procedures, such as the treaty bodies and the Universal Periodic                                                                                                                                                                   associated with employment and decent work were also referenced, including the right to work, and freedom of association and collective bargaining.  3 Ibid, para 2. 4 Human Rights Post-2015 Caucus, \ufb01Human Rights for All Post-2015\ufb02 (2013), para 3.

Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Promote Decent Work and Social Protection for All  a) Put into practice the application of the Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights when formulating and implementing poverty eradication measures and other policies. b) Agree to a new goal on full and decent employment and livelihoods, incorporating the four pillars of the Decent Work Agenda of the International Labour Organization (ILO). c) Agree to a stand-alone goal on universal social protection, emphasizing the need to introduce \ufb01nationally tailored\ufb02 social protection floors in countries where social security is minimal, with the aim to secure universal access to social services and basic income security for all, based on ILO Recommendation 202. d) Implement fully the ILO\u2122s core labour standards and reject policies that present the deregulation of labour standards as a necessity to maintain \ufb01competiveness.\ufb02 e) Promote associative forms of work in the social and solidarity economy. f) Combat gendered labour market segregation and implement programmes and policies that aim to redistribute unpaid work.  2. Address Growing Inequalities as an Obstacle to the Fulfillment of Human Rights for All  a) Adopt a stand-alone goal on reversing growing inequalities, and include inequality reduction targets in all other goals; ensure data is disaggregated by gender, age, geographical location, rural/urban location, socio-economic and other relevant indicators.   3. Promote Peace to Realize Human Rights and Sustainable Development  a) Adopt a stand-alone goal to eliminate violence and insecurity to promote sustainable development and peace for all social groups; targets should i) refer to access to security as a public good; ii) ensure all social groups are free from violence and insecurity; and iii) eliminate violence targeting women and girls.  4. Ensure the Right to Food  a) Reaffirm commitment to the realization and fulfillment of the right to adequate, safe, affordable, and nutritious food to ensure that all are free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. Include a target to ensure food sovereignty, health, and nutrition security.   5. Ensure the Right to Health, including Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights  a) Complete the unfinished business of the unmet health MDGs (reaffirm the fights to safeguard women\u2122s health, eliminate child and maternal deaths, and prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) while adapting to new health challenges and addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Recognize that the health burden of NCDs is increasing in all regions of the world, undermining social and economic                                                  5 Ibid.

Linking the Post-2015 agenda on human rights with the Post-2015 agenda on the private sector IHRB welcomes the central role accorded to both human rights and the private sector in the  the Post-2015 Agenda and in subsequent discussions. The Post-2015 agenda and more specifically the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provide an important opportunity to inextricably link the two agendas in a far more definitive way than the presentation in the High Level Panel Report.  Business can make an important contribution to promoting economic growth, but should do so in ways that respects human rights. The corporate responsibility to respect human rights in line with the UN Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights adopted unanimously by the Human Rights Council in 2011 should be a core part of any SDGs addressing or involving the private sector. The SDGs also provide a critical opportunity to reaffirm the role of governments in setting the framework for responsible business, including through regulation where appropriate, and through the use of appropriate incentives and disincentives.    2. Integrating human rights into all relevant Goals rather than developing a separate human rights goal in the SDGs IHRB strongly supports the approach of integrating human rights principles and processes across the SDG framework, rather than creating a separate, stand-alone goal focused on human rights. An integrated approach sends the right message that human rights are a core part of the way governments, businesses and civil society should carry out their operations to meet the goals.  Separating human rights into a stand-alone approach would also not make sense for the private sector as it would not reflect the way businesses are currently managing human rights risks and impacts.  The clear trend is towards integrating and managing human rights issues alongside other sustainability issues.  In addition, this would not reflect the agreed approach set out in the UN   2 Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework which makes clear that business has a broader, general responsibility to respect human rights in all contexts and all operations.   3. Linking the Post-2015 agenda on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) with human rights  The Report on the Post-2015 Agenda places renewed emphasis on public-private partnerships as an organisational form to address some of the key challenges identified in the Post-2015 agenda. IHRB welcomes the opening of collaboration between the public and the private sector to address global development challenges. We believe that unlocking private sector potential to contribute towards realising the goals can be a key part of the Post-2015 agenda, but we would also strongly recommend that the focus on PPPs includes an appropriate emphasis on accountability for all actors involved and draws on relevant standards and the UN Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework on business and human rights more specifically.  Governments should be reminded of their obligations to respect, protect, fulfil and promote human rights within the framework of PPPs while businesses participating in PPPs should equally be required to carry out appropriate human rights due diligence processes consistent with their responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  While governments continue to have an obligation to protect human rights, under PPPs, certain responsibilities may be transferred to businesses, requiring an even more proactive approach to human rights.   4. Making a clear statement on the need to reinforce mechanisms to hold companies to account IHRB welcomes the initiatives by the Global Compact and numerous businesses to promote mandatory corporate reporting on financial and non-financial risks as a part of the SDGs.  Transparency can be an effective and efficient avenue to unlocking new analysis, new collaborations, and new initiatives for accountability.  However, making this the sole response to demands for corporate accountability would undermine the importance the High Level Panel Report attaches to credible systems of accountability as a core part of the SDGs.  Equally important, limiting the corporate accountability agenda solely to reporting would undermine the credibility of the renewed emphasis on the private sector in the Post-2015 agenda.  That privileged position in the Post-2015 Agenda must be accompanied by commitments to responsibility and accountability that go beyond what companies choose to self-report.  IHRB recommends that the SDGs contain a clear call for a range of accountability mechanisms  judicial and non-judicial  to address company actions, reflecting the emphasis in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights on the importance of effective remedy for human rights harms relating to business conduct.      3 5. Strengthening references and linkages to core systemic issues involving the private sector  The Post-2015 agenda and the SDGs provide a rare opportunity to marry and integrate core agendas around global public goods that have been proceeding on parallel tracts in international discussions.    Those agendas are too important not to be given a central place in the Post-2015 agenda. The Post-2015 agenda and the SDGs should take on the hard but fruitful task of achieving policy coherence across major international frameworks.  In this vein, we would highlight the importance of interlinking the human rights, climate change and development agendas in the Post-2015 architecture.   This interlinking should be substantive, recognising the hard choices involved such as weighing impacts of specific interventions and considering their overall cumulative impact, while also addressing how to balance competing priorities.    money laundering, tax evasion and hidden ownership of assets, and encourages strong attention to these issues across the SDGs while emphasising their linkage to human rights. We also support deliberations and targets that go even further and explore the far less obvious, more difficult, but equally as fruitful linkages between international financial regulation and sustainable development. This will not be achieved in the short-term but the SDGs can set the vision and goals for international capital markets that are shaped to deliver value for societies for the long term. This includes using regulatory and other incentives and disincentives to drive the inclusion of currently externalised environmental and social costs into the costs of products and services and thus establishing the true and fair price of their impacts on society.  6. Paying attention to terminology that could be fundamentally misconstrued by constituencies All those involved in shaping the Post-2015 agenda must be careful to construct its terminology and frameworks using clear terms that are capable of being understood by ordinary citizens across cultures. Every effort must be made to avoid misuse of language, including shifts in terminology that may not only confuse stakeholders but that can be misconstrued, purposely or innocently, to change the intended purpose or meaning of commonly used terms.  We would flag a term with such This term is confusing because of the ambiguity it creates: is it about the long-term sustainability of the corporation which is a valid consideration for the corporation itself and its shareholders but not a vital issue for the Post-2015 agenda or is it about corporate contributions to  are far preferable.    Disability rights need to be included in a development framework, underpinned by human rights Briefing Paper for the Open Working Group Session on Human Rights, December 2013 There is wide recognition that progress within the existing MDG framework has not been equitable and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately represented among those left behind by recent development gains. The human rights of persons with disabilities as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) need to be translated into the new sustainable development framework. The new framework underpinned by human rights can serve as an instrument for people and countries to help unseat the structural obstacles to sustainable, inclusive and just development, and prevent conflict and stimulate implementation and enforcement of all human rights. The new framework must be accessible for and inclusive of persons with disabilities, and promote the rights and full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in response to the growing commitments on international level: \u00a5 The UN CRPD, ratified by 138 countries, is the only human rights treaty with a stand-alone article on international cooperation. \u00a5 The UN Secretary General\u00d5s Report \u00d2Keeping the Promise: Realizing MDGs for Persons with Disabilities Towards 2015 and Beyond\u00d3 and the report of the High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda both call for disaggregation of data based on disability and the mainstreaming of persons with disabilities in the new development goals.   \u00a5 The Outcome Document of the High-Level Meeting on Disability and Development stressed \u00d2the importance of ensuring accessibility for and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development and of giving due consideration to all persons with disabilities in the emerging post-2015 United Nations development agenda.\u00d3 \u00a5 The UN General Assembly Resolution 67/140 called for \u00d2realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond.\u00d3 \u00a5 The OHCHR study on Art. 32 recognises that international cooperation activities need to be inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities to ensure the full realization of the objectives and purpose of the UN CRPD. \u00a5 The MDG Summit Outcome Document of September 2010 highlighted the need for inclusion of persons with disabilities.  \u00a5 In 2011, the Busan Outcome Document on aid effectiveness embraced disability as a principle underpinning effective development.  \u00a5 The Rio+20 Outcome Document stressed that governments must commit to the promotion of sustainable development policies that support inclusive housing and social services; a safe and healthy living environment for all, in particular for persons with disabilities. The Secretary-General, when setting the goals for the post-2015 development agenda, recognised disability as one of the cross-cutting issues that needs to be taken into account when designing goals and targets. This is exactly how we would like to see the new development agenda \u00d0 the development and utilization of targets and indicators, which are inclusive of and sensitive to persons with disabilities.  According to the WHO and World Bank World Report on Disability, there are one billion persons with disabilities globally who need to be explicitly mentioned and included in the new development agenda that: \u00a5 upholds human rights for all, eliminates discrimination and diminishes inequalities \u00a5 builds on equal and meaningful participation of persons with disabilities at all levels  \u00a5 stimulates transparency and implements participatory accountability mechanisms \u00a5 builds on indicators, disaggregated by disability in addition to gender, age and geographical location  The right to development and the ability to develop along with all human rights is dependent upon the human right to freshwater and food. The right to clean water has been recognized as an international human right, which countries are obliged to adhere to. it needs to include all the conditions essential for making universal access to clean freshwater and sanitation possible for all human beings regardless of income, for present and future generations. To truly implement the right to clean drinking water and sanitation for all in present times and inclusive of future generations, an adequate quantity of freshwater is required. How to potentially achieve this is a vital factor, which needs to be addressed as a central issue to all human rights and even within the context of 'A Stand Alone Water Sustainable Development Goal\u00d5. This is critical in realizing Sustainable Development Goals and in achieving a successful Post 2015 agenda, which accords with the Millennium Development Declaration.   Issues of water quantity and quality, scarcity and access are of paramount importance to all communities throughout the world. Food security is utterly dependent upon this. If there is insufficient freshwater available it will naturally infringe on the human rights to water and food by undermining the availability of a sufficient and continuous water supply for personal, domestic and agricultural needs. This issue needs proper attention and immediate action taken to avoid the crisis, conflicts and suffering that will inevitably occur otherwise. There needs to be legislative action taken which protects all freshwater sources from all harmful, polluting and abusive endeavors such as mining and certain large scale hydro-dams. There also needs to be actions taken that increase the recharge functions of freshwater. Unlike resources such as coal, oil and gas the freshwater cycle is a renewable and regenerative one. Rather than being a limited resource it is an infinite renewable and has the ability of being replenished. However this cycle is utterly dependent upon healthily functioning ecosystems such as mountains with their snows, glaciers and mixed forests. The critical importance of this issue was acknowledged as the central factor in achieving water security in the United Nations Water Security Analytical Brief, which was produced by the UN Water Task Force and released on World Water Day 22nd March 2013. It states: \u00d2Ensuring that ecosystems are protected and conserved is central to achieving water security \u00d0 both for people and for nature. Ecosystems are vital to sustaining the quantity and quality of water available within a watershed, on which both nature and people rely. Maintaining the integrity of ecosystems is essential for supporting the diverse needs of humans, and for the sustainability of ecosystems, including protecting the water- provisioning services they provide.\u00d3  2013, The International Year of Water Cooperation reflects the global recognition that freshwater is an absolute necessity for achieving internationally agreed upon Sustainable Development Goals. These include the nexus between water security, food security, poverty eradication, gender equality, human health, equity, peace and prosperity. It also reflects the emerging global understanding that the safeguarding of ecosystems and their life-supporting functions, needs to be implemented to resolve current and future water challenges. This issue has generally been overlooked, although it is a key factor in successfully achieving the human right to water. This matter was given recognition and highlighted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Conference in Rio in 2012 and was endorsed in the government signed document: \u00d4The Future We Want\u00d5. Paragraph 122 states: \"We recognize the key role that ecosystems play in maintaining water quantity and quality and support actions within the respective national boundaries to protect and sustainably manage these ecosystems.\"   The same Analytical Brief noted that natures ecosystems and cycles could reach a tipping point and cease to function.  \u00d2Maintaining the integrity of ecosystems before they become compromised is an essential component of achieving water security and reducing the potential for conflicts. The continuous pace of human development is threatening the capacity of ecosystems to adapt, raising concerns that ecosystems will reach a tipping point after which they are no longer able to provide sustaining functions and services, and will become unable to recover their integrity and functions.  Given this understanding and these conditions government obligations need to include legislation that both protects and restores the environments, which the hydrological cycle is utterly dependent upon within the contents of the human right to water and sanitation These include mountains (the water towers of the world), mixed mountain forests, rain forests and wetlands. This has already ben acknowledged by some of the worlds leading authorities as central factors in achieving National and International security. This is a major security issue and needs to be given appropriate attention to ensure world peace and stability. This is essential to both secure human development to date and to continue in accord with Sustainable Development principles.  The Human Rights Council as an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system is responsible for the strengthening, promotion and protection of human rights around the globe. As such, it is of paramount importance that it acts as a model of excellence for ethical and effective democratic processes through its work. It is vital that those elected to the Council on November 12 2013, (Algeria, China, Cuba, France, Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, United Kingdom and Vietnam) ensure open and honest procedures during their term on the council, allowing democratic sovereign states to take principled and independent stances. It is also imperative to bring the contents of the human rights declaration and Conventions up to date with present day reality, incorporating environmental rights essential for living a life in dignity, so that all human rights can be truly implemented and enforced with no exceptions.  Stella Joy Co Director Active Remedy Ltd www.activeremedy.org.uk   Growing inequality in all corners of the globe has demonstrated with certainty that the MDGs approach, conceived more than a decade ago, was unable to meet the important challenges associated with social development. Driven by a narrow focus on aid and rooted in an economic growth paradigm, the MDGs overlooked almost entirely the human rights dimension of development, and the crucial role they play in supporting sustainable socio-economic progress. Amartya Sen (1999) argued, \ufb01In judging economic development, it is not adequate to look only at the growth of GNP or some other indicators of over-all economic expansion. We have to look also at the impact of democracy and political freedoms on the lives and capabilities of the citizens.\ufb02 Therefore, real progress is measureable also by the degree with which peoples can enjoy fundamental human rights in practice and effectively exercise democratic participation. Concretely, this means that, for example, we cannot talk of \u201aachieved development\u2122 in a given country if labour standards and decent work are not promoted, the right to collective bargaining is not respected, and participatory modalities as social dialogue are not granted in the \u02dcrst place.A sustainable development model needs to be based on international human rights commitments and standards, embedded in internationally agreed instruments.  Accountability based on international norms is the very embodiment of what the Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) to development. Indeed, as the UN Of\u02dcce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) put it, the HRBA is a broader \ufb01conceptual framework for the process of human development that is norm-atively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights.\ufb02 It seeks to analyse \ufb01the inequalities which lie at the heart of development problems and redress discriminatory practices and unjust distributions of power that impede development progress\ufb02 (OHCHR, 2006, p. 15). Still, the question remains on how to translate this in practice. Recently donor governments (and multilateral institutions) have revitalised the HRBA within their policies, developing programmatic tools and guidelines to promote human rights in their bilateral development cooperation1. However, these rather fragmented and operational approaches, although well-intentioned, do not seem to embrace the core implication of the HRBA, which is the issue of globally shared responsibility/accountability for development.In 1986 the UN Declaration on the Right to Development2, already pointed in this direction. \ufb01The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized\ufb023. Moreover, according to the Declaration, \ufb01States have the duty to co-operate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development.  States should realize their rights and ful\u02dcl their duties in such a manner as to promote a new international economic order based on sovereign equality, interdependence, mutual interest and co-operation among all States, as well as to encourage the observance and realization of human rights\ufb024. The duty to cooperate would imply a shift from individual state responsibilities (concerning the relationship between the State and the people under its jurisdiction5) towards a broader concept of extraterritorial responsibility/obligations of states beyond their borders6. Consequently, states (duty bearers) would be accountable for a wider range of external policies, like trade, debt, and \u02dcnance in particular, that might have negative backlash on the human rights of recipient populations (rights holders), being the latter inside or outside their territories.Despite this progressive stand, however, the Declaration has no binding attributes, and does not include any mandatory obligations or accountability mechanism on States. 1 For a review of multilateral institutions and donor governments\u2122 positions on HRBA see: Promoting a Human Rights based approach within the development effectiveness agenda, HIVA & GGS, June 2013 p.112 http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r128.htm 3 Ibidem art 1 para 14 Ibidem art 3 para 35 \ufb01Both the human rights and governance traditions locate accountability primarily in the relationship between the State and its citizens and others under its jurisdiction. Under international human rights law, States have the \u02dcrst and main responsibility to respect and protect the rights of people within their territories or under their effective control\ufb02, Who will be accountable? OHCHR, 2013, p. 17.6 On Extraterritorial responsibility see OHCHR 2013 p. 22,48 and Towards a Framework Convention on the Right to Development, De Feyter, FES International Policy Analysis, April 2013 p. 3. \ufb01Human Rights Based Approach\ufb02 in the post 2015 process: The challenge of a global accountability framework On the other hand, it is clear that the principle of states shared accountability continues to evolve in international fora and debates on development, as a result of profound shifts global economy. As noted by OHCHR the \ufb01proliferation of actors in international development has made it necessary to develop a more multidimensional approach. A number of processes associated with globalization, including political decentralization, the privatization of public services and broader transformations in the global economy, have multiplied the number of and interconnections between institutions that shape development. The bond between State and citizen is now at the centre of a more elaborate web of interrelated responsibilities\ufb027.The Millennium Declaration of the UN General Assembly in 2000 refers again to the principle of shared responsibility, calling for greater policy coherence and coordination at international level8. However, the accountability de\u02dccit of MDG 8 - Developing a global partnership for development- is self-evident. Subsequent declarations addressing aid effectiveness - Paris (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008) and more recently the Busan Partnership (2011) \u0152 keep recalling the need for \ufb01accountability to the intended bene\u02dcciaries of our cooperation, as well as to our respective citizens, organisations, constituents and shareholders\ufb029. However, at the same time and quite inconsistently, the Busan Partnership document only makes direct reference to rights-based approaches (RBA) when referring to the role of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs),effectively relegating RBA to CSO-speci\u02dcc engagements, and not to the overall stakeholders\u2122 development agenda.It should be clearly established that given the shift in the global development settings, the issue of shared responsibility should not be limited to state entities only but should pertain to \u201anon-state actors\u2122 as well, such as private business and multilateral organisations, whose actions directly impact on development processes and human rights10. The question remains: how do we create global governance framework in development based on internationally agreed human rights commitments, holding all relevant actors accountable? The post 2015 process presents the international development community an opportunity to really boost policy coherence between development promotion and human rights commitments11. Proposals have been put forward in this regard, with the aim of building on existing reporting mechanisms at international level, such as Economic and Social Council\u2122s annual voluntary ministerial review process12, as well as, the Universal Periodic review of the Human Rights Council13. It is argued that \ufb01states should streamline their post 2015 and international human rights reporting obligations, ensuring that their respective national reporting processes and accountability mechanisms reinforce one other\ufb0214.However, a holistic approach de\u02dcning the integration of development and human rights in one normative and binding instrument seems to be by far the best option. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) framework and its standards based tripartite accountability mechanisms constitute a long-standing example of how relevant and effective this can be. A new binding framework, including its accountability mechanisms, should be agreed at global level. This framework should reaf\u02dcrm the spirit of the 1986 Declaration and grant three fundamental principles: \ufb01mutual accountability (donors and partners are accountable for development results), alignment of policies among partner countries (donor countries align behind policy objectives set by developing countries), and inclusive partnerships (full participation of State and non-State actors)\ufb0215. Eventually, this would also mean providing concrete mechanisms to ensure policy coherence for development.  7 see OHCHR, 2013, p. 17.8 Resolution 2 session 55 United Nations Millennium Declaration9 The Busan Declaration (2011) reiterates that promoting human rights, democracy and good governance are an integral part of development efforts (\u00a73), as well as, it underlines the consistency with agreed international commitments on human rights, decent work, gender equality, environmental sustainability and disability (\u00a711). It also includes the commitment to accelerate efforts to achieve gender equality and women\u2122s empowerment (\u00a720).10 The private sector should respect and apply the ILO principles and labour standards as elaborated in the ILO Conventions and monitored by the ILO supervisory system; more in particular the MNEs, should observe the Guiding Principles on Business  The private sector should respect and apply the ILO principles and labour standards as elaborated in the ILO Conventions and monitored by the ILO supervisory system; more in particular the MNEs, should observe the Guiding Principles on Business  should respect and apply the ILO principles and labour standards as elaborated in the ILO Conventions and monitored by the ILO supervisory system; more in particular the MNEs, should observe the Guiding Principles on Business should respect and apply the ILO principles and labour standards as elaborated in the ILO Conventions and monitored by the ILO supervisory system; more in particular the MNEs, should observe the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201aProtect, Respect and Remedy\u2122 Framework, the ILO Tripartite Declaration on MNEs and Social Policy, the OECD Guidelines for MNEs. 11 The GPEDC (Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, set up following Busan) involvement in the post-2015 process it is still unclear despite calls to ensure complementarity.

ChildFund Alliance conducted 55 focus groups with children in 41 countries, and involving over 1,300 individual children so that their voices can be heard as part of the post-2015 agenda. This study provides horrific examples of violence and exploitation raised by some of the children:  being punished with heated metal rods and spoons;  being abducted so their organs could be harvested;  their hands being dipped in boiling oil;  girls being forced to become pregnant to act as drug mules;  being forced into child marriage to settle family disputes and debts; and  being severely beaten at schools, leading to death.

Despite their awareness of these horrendous violations, children themselves were able to recommend practical solutions to increase their safety. The top three calls to world leaders were to create and enforce legislation against violence; to fund and run awareness campaigns at all levels; and to ensure offenders are punished so that children feel safe. Children stated that they felt free when they were actively listened to, had access to safe schools and the opportunity to play. Globally the top three forms of violence and exploitation identified by children were sexual violence, child labour and physical and humiliating punishment. African children also highlighted harmful traditional practices and children in the Americas pointed to the issue of bullying. Children also identified other risks, which included drug and alcohol abuse, dropping out of school and pregnancy, as well as being forced to engage in criminal activity.     5  Introduction  Throughout the world, children are subject to the worst forms of child labour, living and working in the streets; harmful traditional practices, such as child marriage, and female genital mutilation and cutting; sexual abuse; the impact of armed conflict, including the use of child soldiers by armed forces and gangs; lack of access to justice, including child-friendly justice, and unnecessary institutionalization, among others. Preventing and responding to violence and exploitation is essential to ensuring rights to survival, development and well-being. The impact of violence and exploitation is known. Countries with high rates of child labour tend to have low rates of school attendance. Children who study in a violent environment achieve lower academic results than those who do not. A child victim of abuse and exploitation can be affected emotionally, mentally and physically, and his or her ability to learn and socialize can be seriously hampered. If the post-2015 development framework is to carry the torch of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and if the next generation of development goals is to finish the job of the current one, violence and exploitation must be explicitly included and addressed. To enhance the voices of children in this process, this report looks at qualitative data from 55 focus groups with over 1300 children who participated in this process, and also analyses 6,500 MY World votes from children on their priorities for the post-2015 agenda.

From these focus group discussions, there were a series of common concerns and themes that children identified regarding their own protection from violence and exploitation. They include:  Children aspire to have their rights fulfilled and to be able to exercise their fundamental freedoms including the right to non-discrimination, and the right to participate in the decisions that affect their lives.  The experience of violence and exploitation perpetrated against these children takes many different forms, most prominently sexual violence, child labour, and physical and humiliating punishment.  While many children stressed that both girls and boys are victims of violence and exploitation, they pointed to the fact that girls are more exposed to violence and exploitation related to their sexuality, while boys are more at risk of being subjected to physical harm.     6  About this Report  Child participation is not only a right, but also a general principle and part of the general measures of implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). This means that the Convention cannot be fully realised if children are not respected as rights-holding citizens and their views are listened to and given due weight. Furthermore, participation is highly valued and acknowledged in the UN Study on Violence against Children.1 Of the 12 overarching recommendations of the Study, the seventh  participation, and calls upon states to engage actively with children and respect their views in all aspects of prevention and response to violence against children. The purpose of this report is to strengthen the voices of girls and boys in the agenda-setting process for the post-2015 development framework. Specifically, this initiative seeks two main objectives: a) in the post-2015 development agenda; b) to fill a gap in qualitative research regarding exploitation perpetrated against them, and their place in the post-2015 development agenda. Understanding and defining violence and exploitation from the perspective of girls and boys is crucial, as it plays a fundamental role in developing child-centred measures to address them. To this purpose, focus groups were conducted in 41 countries, all of which engaged between twenty to thirty children in open discussion.                                                            1 Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro (2006), World report on violence against children (United Nations). Available at: http://www.unviolencestudy.org/. While the authors coordinated this process, it is in the end the result of participation.  Methodology This report is based on first-hand information children shared during focus group discussions in 41 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. The selection of the countries was The participation of girls and boys was ensured in each of the focus group discussions and the information coded. To ensure that discussions were conducted in a safe and inclusive environment and to support the facilitators the following documents were shared:  a concept note    a focus group session plan  a list of open-ended questions, with both principal and guiding questions  all the necessary consent forms for children and their caregivers  a reporting guideline These documents were mostly adapted from existing publications. Additionally, the facilitators were provided with feedback and guidance, as and when necessary, to successfully conduct the discussions and collate the information. These focus group discussions provided a platform for girls and boys to discuss child protection concerns, specifically violence against and exploitation of children; to share their understandings and experiences of these issues; and to recommend possible actions to end all forms of violence and exploitation perpetrated against children.   7  Facilitators asked the following questions, with the respective sub-questions to guide the dialogue: 1. What makes you feel free? 2. What makes you feel free from violence and exploitation? 3. What makes you feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation? 4. What can world leaders do to free children from violence and exploitation? 5. What can adults do to free children from violence and exploitation? 6. What are the risks that children face? Are they different for boys or girls? What are the risks for girls? What are the risks for boys? 7. Is there anything else you would like to say about the protection of children from violence, exploitation and abuse? The process applied the standards for child participation as highlighted in the General Comment No. 12, enabling children to express their opinion and develop their recommendations. The graphs indicate what percentage of the total number of focus groups raised a particular issue. Annex 2, at the back of the report, sets out the coding that was used to collate the answers.

Convention on the Rights of the Child In all focus group discussions, children expressed the aspiration of having their rights fulfilled, and their fundamental freedoms respected. This aspiration mostly related to participation, education, health, food and their right to play. Children also pointed out that there needed to be more awareness about c, and that adults at all levels need to ensure that this happens.  respected by my parents, the leaders, and the s 17-year-old girl, Guinea  1.1. Participation Throughout the focus groups, participation came across as one of the strongest aspirations of children. They were aware of the differences between effective participation and tokenism; of the settings in which their opinions should be brought to bear; and of the value that this would add to decision-making processes. Many children mentioned that they wanted to  heard by adults and decision- makers. In many cases, the possibility of expressing their opinions and views was correlated with the reduction of violence. Children expressed their desire to be partners Intergenerational dialogue was fundamental for children to feel safe and for children to be able to take action.  and the elder 15-year-old girl, Bolivia  1.2. Discrimination Children spoke about the desire to be free from discrimination in general. They expressed their aspirations for a life free from discrimination, where children receive equal treatment in schools and are afforded equal opportunities. More often than not, children talked about the need to stop gender discrimination, both as a violation against children but also as a solution to reduce violence and exploitation. The other dimension that was mentioned was discrimination against children with disabilities.   15-year-old boy, Liberia  1.3. Survival In nearly all focus groups children identified their right to the provision of basic needs, their right to survival and to health. The realization of these rights was seen as contributing to them feeling free and being free from violence. For most children, basic needs were defined as adequate food and healthcare. Children made the link between a lack of resources and their feelings of safety. They identified that they were more at risk of violence and exploitation if the household was not able to meet its basic needs. Children talked of being forced on the street to beg for money and being forced into early marriages to pay off debt.    9  2. Education and schools According to children, three situations hinder their access to education. First, child labour whether agricultural, domestic or otherwise was mentioned as one of the factors preventing boys and girls from having access to education. Second, security was also identified as one of the obstacles for children going to school, as they often do not feel safe on their way from and to their homes. Third, teachers who resort to physical and humiliating punishment were education, and as contributing to the fact that, on occasion, children do not feel safe not to mention happy and free in school. At the same time children identified schools as a place where they were subject to violations from teachers and other students. They called upon teachers and Governments to do more to ensure that their schools are safe and free from violence. Children emphasized the need for an easy and smooth reporting system and for administrators to ensure that action is taken against perpetrators. Many participants called for an end to sexual harassment in schools and suspension of any teacher caught harassing students.  abusing chi 15-year-old girl, Liberia  3. Create and enforce legislation  The importance of laws and their implementation was raised in various ways in nearly all focus groups. Children want their leaders to make child rights known and respected to protect them. Children in each region identified the importance of world leaders to both create and enforce legislation to prevent and respond to violence against children. Governments should not only enact laws but have to strive to enforce the  15-year-old boy, Ethiopia  4. Punish offenders and perpetrators The importance of punishing offenders of violence against children was of slightly higher importance in Africa and the Americas than Asia. For children, this call to punish offenders and perpetrators of violence against them indicates the high level of concern they face having offenders and perpetrators living amongst them, leaving them open to re-offending. It is well documented that violence against children does not just happen in isolated cases; many children are subject to multiple forms of abuse.  adults to the point that a child cannot go to the chief for a complaint. Also people are not courageous enough to  14-year-old boy, Burkina Faso  5. Community awareness Children identified the importance of community awareness for adults including parents, teachers, leaders, local leaders and caregivers. They felt this could be achieved through mass media campaigns. Children also made suggestions about where and how community awareness campaigns could take place, including at local markets, coffee ceremonies and through radio. Raising awareness on the effects of violence against and exploitation of children was a common solution given by children. Whether regarded as something they can do themselves, or as actions adults could implement, children from all three regions saw in awareness raising   10  an effective way to prevent and address violence and exploitation.  parents, teachers and community leaders to take real actions to stop violence and every form of exploitation against  13-year-old girl, Timor Leste  6. Severe and numerous forms of violence and exploitation perpetrated against children Children raised many different experiences of violence and exploitation. Some of the more extreme forms of violence included: being punished with heated metal rods and spoons, being abducted so their organs could be boiling oil, girls being forced to become pregnant to act as drug mules, children being forced into child marriage to settle family disputes and debts and being severely beaten at schools leading to death. In many focus groups, children talked about the fact that both boys and girls faced similar risks of being subject to violence and exploitation. For example, child labour was raised for girls as mostly domestic labour and for boys it was in the context of agriculture. Sexual violence was also seen as a violation that both boys and girls experienced. The top three shared experiences of violence were sexual violence, child labour, and physical and humiliating punishment.  Across the different focus groups, children recognised that boys and girls faced higher risks of particular manifestations of violence and exploitation perpetrated against them. While boys and girls were considered at risk of sexual violence, girls were subject to a higher risk of commercial sexual exploitation. When children spoke of different forms of violence and exploitation the list included, in order: sexual violence, child labour, physical and humiliating punishment, trafficking, harmful traditional practices, children associated with armed forces and gangs, and bullying. One of the main forms of violence to which focus groups referred was physical harm, including corporal punishment at home, school and work.  Focus groups also referred to armed conflict or crime-related violence as a constant source of violence and exploitation perpetrated against children.

Throughout the focus group process, children continued to raise issues that they thought needed to be addressed and suggested actions that adults and leaders should take to free children from violence and exploitation. They included, but were not limited to, the following list of recommendations for action:  Services  Run awareness training with parents and teachers to determine ways they could work together to reduce violence.  Map risks at the local level.  Create safe spaces for children.  Give priority to protection programs for children not in school.  Increase the number of local support units.  Use children clubs as a hub for services and activities that keep children safe.  Implement programs that improve the safety of children travelling to school.  Decentralize services to children.  Ensure that water holes are well lit and placed in safe areas.  Implement codes of conduct for teachers  Put c in place.  Conduct self-defence classes.  Implement and fund parenting classes.  Conduct local level surveys of the violations children face.  Children participating in focus group discussion in Ghana. Photo: ChildFund Ghana.  Law enforcement  Run counselling for perpetrators.  Ensure anonymous reporting to the police.  Increase the national and local budgets for the prosecution of offenders.  Ensure all domestic laws increase the age to undertake hazardous work to 18.  Create local police units.  Education  Have a greater focus on the education on the Convention of the Rights of the Child and other international instruments.  Implement a worldwide campaign on violence.     12  Global findings: A graphic summary           13                              What children need to feel free What children need to feel free from violence and exploitation What world leaders should do to free children from violence and exploitation   14           1% 6% 17% 19% 21% 25% 29% 29% 36% 37% 40% 42% 43% 44% 44% 46% 53% 65% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%No answerOtherPolitical freedomsBetter job opportunitiesPhone and internet accessBetter transport and roadsReliable energy at homeAction taken on climate changeProtecting forests, rivers and oceansAffordable and nutritious food Freedom from discrimination and persecutionAccess to clean water and sanitationBetter healthcareAn honest and responsive governmentEquality between men and womenProtection against crime and violenceA good educationChildren's priorities - MY World Total votes: 6,499 Forms of violence and exploitation perpetrated against children 6500 children in 47 countries vote for the priorities the post-2015 agenda should address to make them free   15            22% 24% 24% 29% 29% 36% 40% 44% 49% 56% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%Having their rights respected and fulfilledHaving access to foodBeing in schoolA safe and secure environmentInvolvement of parents in protectionHaving access to healthcareBeing at homeExercising their right to playExercising their right to participateHaving access to educationWhat makes you feel free? 22% 22% 24% 24% 27% 31% 33% 42% 42% 44% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Being free from child labourNot being subject to discriminationBeing safe in their communitiesEngaging in rights educationInvolvement of parents in protectionPerpetrators and offenders being punishedLegislation against violenceBeing safe at homeBeing free from physical and humiliating punishmentBeing safe at schoolWhat makes you feel free from violence and exploitation Global findings from discussion questions   16            16% 22% 22% 22% 24% 24% 27% 31% 33% 33% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Perpetrators and offenders being punishedExercising their right to participateInvolvement of parents in protectionActions and initiatives at the local levelLegislation against violenceHaving access to support unitsActors having defined and established rolesAwareness raising on violence and exploitationEngaging in rights educationEngaging in children's clubs and P2PWhat makes you feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation? 11% 11% 13% 16% 22% 22% 29% 36% 36% 44% 60% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%Create institutionsEnhance safety and securityCreate or enhance support unitsSupport and enhance child participationPromote or support actions at the local levelAddress povertySupport right's educationGuarantee access to educationPunish offenders and perpetratorsRaise awareness on violence and exploitationCreate and enforce legislation against violenceActions world leaders can take   17            11% 11% 13% 13% 13% 13% 13% 22% 24% 27% 29% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Respect children's rightsStop engaging in drug and substance abuseGuarantee access to educationEnforce legislation against violencePromote or support actions at the local levelCreate or enhance support unitsStop physical and humiliating punishmentSupport and engage in right's educationSupport parental involvement in protectionSupport and enhance child participationRaise awareness on violence and exploitationActions adults can take to free children from violence and exploitation 40% 40% 44% 47% 62% 82% 82% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%BullyingChildren associated with armed conflict and gangsHarmful traditional practicesTraffickingPhysical and humiliating punishmentChild labourSexual violenceMost cited forms of violence and exploitation for boys and girls   18    1. What makes you feel free?  1.1. Top issues The primary purpose of this question was to ask what makes children feel happy and safe, and flesh out the things that they want and do not want to happen in their lives. To this question, children brought up specific examples of settings and situations in which they felt free, happy and safe, but also responded with counter-examples of situations in which they did not feel free and felt their rights were violated, including through violence and exploitation. In general terms, aspirations of children regarding what makes them feel free, happy and safe revolved around access to education, decision-making processes, healthcare and food. Emphasis was also placed on being with friends, and carrying out ordinary activities without fear, in safe and secure environments. Across the three regions where the focus group discussions were conducted, three issues were constantly brought up as fundamental for children to feel free: first, access to education; second, the fulfilment of their right to participate; and third, the fulfilment of their right to play.  i. Having access to education In the first place, a majority of participants across countries and regions expressly associated feeling free with having access to education. This issue was brought up in 56% of the focus groups discussions. According to children, three situations hinder their access to education. First, child labour whether agricultural, domestic or otherwise was mentioned as one of the factors preventing boys and girls from having access to education. Second, security was also identified as one of the obstacles for children going to school, as they often do not feel safe on their way from and to their homes. Third, teachers who resort to physical and humiliating punishment were education, and as a factor contributing to the fact that, on occasion, children do not feel safe not to mention happy and free in school. Access to education was the number one answer in Africa, while it was tied in second place in the Americas and Asia, having been mentioned in 58%, 55% and 53% of the focus groups, respectively.  ii. Exercising their right to participate participation in decision-making processes, from home and school to their communities and cities, came across as fundamental for children to feel free. In this sense, 49% of focus groups raised the issue of their involvement in the decisions that affect their lives: of adults actively listening to them and of their opinions being taking into account. The realization of their right to participate was the number one answer in the Americas, while it was in second place in Asia, and in fifth place in Africa, having been mentioned in 73%, 53% and 32% of the focus groups, respectively.  iii. Exercising their right to play Thirdly, children associated feeling free with the possibility of engaging in cultural, leisure and recreational activities. Participating children mentioned being able to exercise their right to play in 44% of the focus groups. To exercise this   19  right, children stated that there need to be the provision of adequate infrastructure on the part of local and national authorities, such as parks and cultural centres. The possibility of exercising their right to play was the number one answer in Asia, while it was tied in second place in the Americas, and came in eighth place in Africa, having been mentioned in 67%, 55% and 21% of the focus groups, respectively.  iv. Other important issues Being at home and being at school were also settings in which children said they felt free, with them being brought up in 20% and 24% of the focus groups, respectively. These answers in relation to this particular question sharply contrast those for other questions, in which home and school were mentioned as settings with both positive and negative connotations i.e. as spaces where children feel protected and safe, but also as spaces where violence and exploitation takes place. Also, children stated that they felt free when communities and public spaces are safe and secure environments. This issue was brought up in 29% of the focus groups, and was mostly associated with the possibility of being able to go outside and walk in the street without fear of violence and exploitation by their peers or by adults. Children cannot feel free if they are subjected to violence or exploitation. Throughout the focus groups, children strongly called for all forms of violence and exploitation against them or their peers to be stopped. Finally, in 29% of the focus groups children associated feeling free with their parents playing an active role in their lives and in their protection from violence and exploitation.      22% 24% 24% 29% 29% 36% 40% 44% 49% 56% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%Having their rights respected and fulfilledHaving access to foodBeing in schoolA safe and secure environmentInvolvement of parents in protectionHaving access to healthcareBeing at homeExercising their right to playExercising their right to participateHaving access to educationWhat makes you feel free? - Globally   20  1.2. Regional breakdown: Africa  respected by my parents, the leaders,  17-year-old girl, Guinea  11-year-old girl, Senegal  In Africa, access to education was mentioned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Togo and Zambia. In Ghana children pointed out the importance school we feel free when there are rules to protect us, and when offenders are punished girls in Liberia expressed that they do not feel free at school when teachers demand sex in exchange for good grades. In Benin, for example, education was not only mentioned as something to which children should have access, but also as something that entails concrete responsibilities for children: working hard in class, studying hard, and doing their homework. Children in Benin thus exhibit an acute awareness of the correlation between rights and responsibilities. In the same sense, a child in the Gambia o focus on my education, to be disciplined and  Children associated feeling free with having access to healthcare services and to food, having been mentioned in 53% and 42% of the focus groups. For example, in Burkina Faso, children placed a high premium on parents nursing them back to health when they are sick, while in other countries access to healthcare was raised as something that the state should provide. Children in Mozambique expressed their aspiration for more inter-generational dialogue between children and adults to enable children to express their opinions on matters about  In Africa weight was also given to the existence and enforcement of legislation to protect children from violence and exploitation, and to offenders being punished, both of which were mentioned in 16% of the focus groups.

Regional breakdown: The Americas  young people, all we want do is  16-year-old girl, Ecuador dreams  15-year-old girl, Bolivia  In the Americas, the realization of their right to participate was linked to children feeling free in Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Paraguay, where children called for adults and authorities to actively listen to their opinions, and for opportunities to express themselves more freely without fear of being punished. In Nicaragua, for example, children stated they feel free when they are allowed to express what they think without being coerced, while in Mexico and Paraguay participation was also linked to children being engaged in communal activities. Moreover, children put an emphasis on the active engagement of their parents in their lives and their protection from violence and exploitation, as well as on exercising their right to play and having access to education. These last three issues were mentioned in 55% of the focus groups. In Ecuador, for example, children stated that in order for them to feel free their domestic chores and other forms of labour should not prevent them from studying or partaking in capacity-building initiatives. Home, school and the community were also brought up as settings where children feel free, having been mentioned in 36%, 27% and 18%. Finally, children made explicit references to actively engaging in initiatives that benefit the community or other people, as something that makes children feel free.

In Nepal, for example, there was consensus about the occurrence of physical punishment in schools, and children unanimously called for schools to become safer. At the same time, in Afghanistan, India, Nepal and the Philippines children mentioned the occurrence of physical and humiliating punishment as a situation in which they did not feel free, or its absence as something that made them feel free. Asia was the only region where some form of violence and exploitation was explicitly brought up in answer to this question.

What makes you feel free from violence and exploitation?  2.1. Top issues The primary purpose of this question was to inquire about what makes children feel safe, and flesh out their views regarding violence and exploitation, as well as their ideas to eliminate them. Children in an overwhelming majority of the focus groups said that they had experienced or witnessed different types of violence at home, in school and in their communities. As in the previous question, children often answered with counter-examples portraying situations of violence and exploitation. Globally, the three most recurrent answers to this question were: being safe at school, being safe at home, and being free from physical and humiliating punishment.  i. Being safe at school and home Globally, being safe at school and home ranked as the top two answers to this question, having been mentioned in 44% and 42% of the focus groups. School and home were mentioned as settings where children felt protected and safe, and thus free from violence and exploitation. However, they were also mentioned as settings where violence and exploitation occurs, and thus places that need to be made safe so that children can feel free from violence and exploitation. Interestingly, these answers point simultaneously to a fulfilled and unfulfilled aspiration on the part of children: safe schools and safe homes. Being safe at school came in second in the Americas and Asia, and was tied in third place in Africa, having been mentioned in 36%, 67% and 32% of the focus groups, respectively. Being safe at home came in first place in Asia, and was tied in third place in the Americas and in fourth place in Africa, having been mentioned in 73%, 27% and 26% of the focus groups, respectively.  ii. Being free from physical and humiliating punishment In the same sense, physical and humiliating punishment, at home and in school, was consistently mentioned as a counter-example: a situation in which children do not feel free from violence and exploitation. However, its absence was also mentioned as a situation in which children do feel free from violence and exploitation. Underlying this answer was a generalized call for physical and humiliating punishment to stop. This issue was brought up by 42% of the focus groups.  iii. Other important issues Children feel free from violence and exploitation when legislation is in place and is enforced by local and national authorities, and when perpetrators of violence against and exploitation of children are punished. These two issues were mentioned in 33% and 31% of the focus groups. Children in 27% of the focus groups stated that they feel free from violence and exploitation when their parents play an active role in their life and in their protection, while rights education was brought up as a contributing factor to children feeling free from violence and exploitation in 24% of the focus groups. In this sense, calls were made not only for adults to engage in educational initiatives concerning themselves to have access to this type of initiatives. Instances of violence and exploitation at the community level were also mentioned as counter-examples in 24% of the focus groups, while discrimination and child labour were brought up in 22% of the focus groups.   25       2.2. Regional breakdown: Africa  adults to the point that a child cannot go to the chief for a complaint. Also people are not courageous  14-year-old boy, Burkina Faso  In Africa, children in 47% of the focus groups stated that they feel free from violence and exploitation when offenders and perpetrators are punished. This was the case in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda. In Guinea, children not rights and protection policies to be enforced by the Government, but also for violations to be  In Kenya, children stated that they feel free from violence and exploitation when they are afforded protection after giving information or evidence about their occurrence, and in Senegal  At the same time, counter-examples were also prevalent, and provided insight into extreme forms of punishment. Indeed, physical and humiliating punishment was brought up in 37% of the focus groups, particularly in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Mali. Children in one of the participating countries in the region, for example, stated that violence against children comprises physical, psychological and verbal abuse, while monetary gain without their consent or taking 22% 22% 24% 24% 27% 31% 33% 42% 42% 44% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Being free from child labourNot being subject to discriminationBeing safe in their communitiesEngaging in rights educationInvolvement of parents in protectionPerpetrators and offenders being punishedLegislation against violenceBeing safe at homeBeing free from physical and humiliating punishmentBeing safe at schoolWhat makes you feel free from violence and exploitation - Globally   26   Meanwhile in another country children provided examples of physical and humiliating  However, children in Africa mostly provided positive examples of places and situations in which they felt free from violence and exploitation. This is the case of rights education (32%), participation (32%), awareness raising other peer-to-peer activities (21%). Children in Ethiopia, for example, explained how their engagement in a school club has provided them with the opportunity to carry out awareness raising activities about the issues of violence against and exploitation of children in their community. This has led, according to them, to a reduction in harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation and cutting; in child abduction and child trafficking; and in the occurrence of physical and humiliating punishment, among others. In Mozambique, children stated that they feel w to protect themselves from violence and become aware of these issues and know how to Zambia said that one way of feeling free from violence and exploitation is to know their own rights and responsibilities, which can be done through sensitization campaigns and enforced by having clear structures for reporting violations. Finally, as was also the case in the Americas and Asia, both home and school were mentioned as settings where children feel free from violence and exploitation, but also as settings where these violations take place.        21% 26% 26% 26% 32% 32% 32% 37% 37% 47% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Engaging in children's clubs and P2PBeing safe at homeHaving access to healthcareAwareness raising on violence and exploitationBeing safe at schoolExercising their right to participateEngaging in rights educationLegislation against violenceBeing free from physical and humiliating punishmentPerpetrators and offenders being punishedWhat makes you feel free from violence and exploitation - Africa   27  2.3. Regional breakdown: The Americas  school, I went to look for him at home. He told me his parents had burned his books and were making him work with them harvesting grains. That is exploitation, because  17-year-old boy, Guatemala  In the Americas, children in 45% of the focus groups stated that they feel free from violence and exploitation when their parents are actively involved in their lives and their protection. Particularly, this was the case in Brazil, Dominica, Mexico, Paraguay and St Vincent. Children in this last country said they feel free from vprotect us, when they look after us, and when  In the Americas, counter-examples of instances of violence and exploitation were prevalent in the answers to this question, including those that took place at school (36%) and at home (27%). Being and feeling safe in these two settings was deemed as fundamental. In Ecuador, children recalled instances of violence within their schools, where teachers and peers abused children physically and verbally, sometimes on the basis of their socio-economic status.  Similar experiences where also recounted in Mexico, where explicit references were given of crime, physical and humiliating punishment, and bullying, and a call for safer environments was made. However, children suggested concrete ways to make them feel free from violence and exploitation, including punishing offenders and perpetrators, awareness raising, putting legislation against violence in place, and providing access to education. For example, in Dominica, children overwhelmingly called for experience of the East Dominica Children Federation as a successful example of awareness raising and rights education. In Honduras, while in Nicaragua they vehemently stated that    Girls in focus group discussion in Guatemala. Photo: ChildFund Guatemala.   28        2.4. Regional breakdown: Asia In Asia, children overwhelmingly brought up counter-examples of instances of violence and exploitation in answer to this question. In India, children almost unanimously said they had experienced some form of violence at home, at school or in their community. They explicitly recounted how teachers regularly victimized children for not doing their homework. To address this situation, they proposed that that they cannot force them into situations  They referred to instances of violence and exploitation at home, at school and in the community in 73%, 67% and 47% of the focus groups, respectively. In Indonesia, children stated that violence was some of them had even been assaulted while using public transportation. A girl from Laos area, and people from the big cities would like to hire us to work for them as housemaids, but my mother wants to sell me to a restaurant to  At the same time, instances of physical and humiliating punishment (60%), child labour (47%), discrimination (40%), sexual violence (27%), and lack of appropriate care (20%) were mentioned as preventing children from feeling free from violence and exploitation. Children in the Philippines mentioned that being free from violence and exploitation spanked by parents; not being bullied by classmates; not being embarrassed by teachers; not engaging in  In Timor Leste, moreover, children told about instances of sexual exploitation at the community level, recmembers peddle young girls to other people in sexually abuse them. 18% 27% 27% 27% 27% 27% 27% 27% 36% 45% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Being free from bullyingBeing safe at homeHaving access to educationLegislation against violenceAwareness raising on violence and exploitationPerpetrators and offenders being punishedBeing free from physical and humiliating punishmentBeing free from crimeBeing safe at schoolInvolvement of parents in protectionWhat makes you feel free from violence and exploitation - Americas   29  Solutions were also suggested on the part of children to address these issues.

What makes you feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation?  3.1. Top issues This question was geared toward inquiring about the conditions under which children feel empowered enough to take action against violence and exploitation, and about the enabling factors and obstacles they face when they do so. There is no doubt that adults should take action to stop all forms of violence against children. However, focus groups expressed that it is crucial that adults think of children as allies in all interventions to free children from violence and exploitation. Children feel they are able to initiate action if the adults are appreciative and supportive of their initiatives. Children would also feel free to take action if their parents and caregivers acknowledged that children could be involved in preventing and responding to violence and exploitation. In answer to this question children came up with concrete actions that could be taken so that they feel free and empowered to take action against violence. Globally, the three most clubs and other peer-to-peer initiatives, as well as in education raising on violence and exploitation; and actors having defined and established roles.  i. Engaging in chi As stated before, participation is one of the most crucial issues for children to feel free and safe. Having spaces where they can voice their aspirations, concerns and opinions is a constant call across the different countries where the focus groups were conducted. Children also aspire to being able to engage in inter-generational dialogue with their parents, teachers and other adults, whom they claim should actively listen to them. other child-led organizations were regarded as empowering mechanisms that provide children with the opportunity to intervene in the public life of their communities, and acquire skills for an active exercise of citizenship in a supportive environment. common answer to the question on what makes children feel free from violence and exploitation, having been brought up in 33% of the focus groups. It came in first in Africa, where it was mentioned in 42% of the focus groups; was tied in third place in Asia, where it was mentioned in 27% of the focus groups; and was tied in fourth place in the Americas, where it came up in 18% of the focus groups.  ii. Engaging in rights education Along with being able to participate in the decisions that affect them, children see in rights education a highly effective mechanism for them to feel free and safe. Being aware of their rights and having adults rights were regarded as adequate ways to empower children to take action to stop violence and exploitation. Across the three regions, two different sides of rights education were highlighted: children want not only to learn about their rights and for other children to be aware of them, but also for rights so that they refrain from subjecting them to violence and exploitation, and support  Engaging in rights education was tied in first place, having been mentioned in 33% of the focus groups. It was the most common answer in the Americas, was tied in first place in Asia, and was tied in fifth place in Africa, having been mentioned in 45%, 47% and 16% of the focus groups, respectively.   31  iii. Awareness raising on violence and exploitation Raising awareness on the effects and implication of violence against and exploitation of children was one of the most common answers regarding possible solutions to this issue. Whether regarded as something they can do themselves, or as actions adults could implement, children from all three regions saw in awareness raising an effective way to prevent and address violence and exploitation. Ideas to raise awareness ranged from child-led activities with communal and local impact, to worldwide campaigns involving the media. Globally, awareness raising came in third, having been mentioned in 31% of the focus groups. It came in second in Asia, and was tied in third place in the Americas and Africa, having been mentioned in 40%, 27% and 26% of the focus groups, respectively.  iv. Actors having defined and established roles Children are aware that there is a multiplicity of actors that play a role in their protection from violence and exploitation, from their parents to their local and national Governments, to multilateral organizations. In this regard, one of the obstacles that was most commonly identified was the lack of coordination amongst these actors, whether persons or institutions. Children vehemently called for establishing roles at the different levels, and having actors adhere to these roles in their protection of children from violence and exploitation. Globally, this answer was brought up in 27% of the focus groups. It came in second place in Africa, was tied in third place in the Americas, having been brought up in 42% and 27% of the focus groups, respectively.  v. Other important issues Across the regions where the focus groups were conducted, it became apparent that for children to feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation their local and national Governments must take a series of steps: they must provide access for them and their parents to support units, such as psycho-social assistance and counselling (24%); they must enact and enforce legislation to protect children from violence and exploitation (24%); they must implement initiatives at the communal and local levels (22%); and they must punish offenders and perpetrators of violence and exploitation (16%). Furthermore, children expressed they felt free to take action when they have the support of their parents, and when they play an active role in their lives and in their protection from violence and exploitation; and when they are afforded the possibility to exercise their right to participate, both through conducive spaces and through active listening on the part of parents and other adults.     32     3.2. Regional breakdown: Africa  violence and exploitation against children should be treated without  Sierra Leone stop violence against children.  Gambia  In Africa, children in 47% of the focus groups stated that their engagement in child-led organizations and other peer-to-peer activities makes them feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation. In the first place, the weight afforded to this answer sheds light on right to participate in the decisions that affect them. It shows children want spaces where they can express their opinion, engage in activities that afford them the necessary skills for an active exercise of citizenship, and take action against the issues that affect their communities. Secondly, this answer also provides insight into the importance of peer support, which in this way can be regarded as fundamental in the empowerment of children to take action. In Ethiopia, children said they feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation when engage in teaching the community about the  Children in Mozambique recalled how, despite the resistance of parents and other adults, the lectures with parents and caregivers to educate on certain forms of violence and exploitation. In Zambia, highlighted as safe spaces to bring about change through peer-to-peer sensitization. At the same time, children also called for the different actors to have defined and established roles in 42% of the focus groups. For example, in Liberia they emphasized the importance of 16% 22% 22% 22% 24% 24% 27% 31% 33% 33% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Perpetrators and offenders being punishedExercising their right to participateInvolvement of parents in protectionActions and initiatives at the local levelLegislation against violenceHaving access to support unitsActors having defined and established rolesAwareness raising on violence and exploitationEngaging in rights educationEngaging in children's clubs and P2PWhat makes you feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation? - Globally   33  every actor fulfilling its role in the protection of children from violence and exploitation, from parents to schoolteachers and administrators, community leaders, local and national Governments, and world leaders. This was also the case in Kenya, where the role of a working system was also highlighted; and in Uganda, children an Actions at the communal and local levels, as well as awareness raising, were also regarded as fundamental for children to feel free to take action against violence and exploitation. In Ghana, for example, children were in agreement that, at the community level,       3.3. Regional breakdown: The Americas  makes me confident to do something  Mexico  In the Americas, two enabling factors were mentioned as fundamental for children to feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation in 45% of the focus groups: engagement in rights education, and the enactment and enforcement of legislation to protect children. Jointly, these two answers point to the importance of not only having enforceable legal frameworks for the protection of children from violence and exploitation, but also of adults and children being aware of the rights afforded by these frameworks. Answers to this question also point to the need to shed light on the magnitude and implications of violence and exploitation through awareness raising initiatives, and of these frameworks defining the responsibilities of each set of actors in the protection of children from violence and exploitation. Both of these issues were mentioned in 27% of the focus groups. 16% 21% 21% 21% 21% 26% 26% 26% 42% 47% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Not being subject to discriminationBeing safe at schoolBeing safe in their communitiesExercising their right to playInvolvement of parents in protectionExercising their right to participateAwareness raising on violence and exploitationActions and initiatives at the local levelActors having defined and established rolesEngaging in children's clubs and P2PWhat makes you feel free to take action to stop violence and exploitation? - Africa   34  Finally, a call was also made for parents to play a more active role in the protection of children from violence and exploitation in 36% of the focus groups. This was the case, for example in Ecuador, where children were vocal in affirming that adults are the ones in whose hands it is to stop violence against and exploitation of children. This includes not only parents, but also teachers, local and national authorities, and civil society organizations. In Nicaragua, children stated that to take action against violence and exploitation what they needed the most was adults to believe them when they report instances of violence and exploitation.      3.4.

What can world leaders do to free children from violence and exploitation?  4.1. Top issues The primary purpose of this question was to enquire what children would like world leaders to say, do and make happen in relation to the prevention of violence against and exploitation of children. While children often said they could not name world leaders, they knew what actions they should take to free them from violence and exploitation.  Across the regions, children were clear on what they saw as the most important actions world leaders could take, which included: first, create and enforce legislation against children; second, raise awareness on violence and exploitation against children; third, punish offenders and perpetrators; and fourth, guarantee access to education.  agenda. Not just by talking about the  17-year-old boy, Zambia  i. Create and enforce legislation against children Children in each region identified the importance of world leaders to both create and enforce legislation on prevention and response to violence against children. Globally, 60% of the focus groups raised this issue as a priority for world leaders to address. This was highest in Asia with 80% of the focus groups raising the issue, followed by Africa with 58%. For children in the Americas, it was lower at 36%. However, in all three regions it was the top priority. This indicates the importance that children place on holding world leaders to account, both for legislation to free children from violence and for the enforcement of that legislation. For these children, laws themselves are not enough.  ii. Raise awareness on violence and exploitation against children The call for world leaders to raise awareness of violence against children was highest in Africa. In the Americas, it was listed alongside punishing offenders and enhancing security. In Asia, it was the third most common action that children asked from world leaders. Children who participated in the focus groups felt that awareness by parents, teachers, community leaders and others about violence and exploitation against them would have an impact in decreasing violence. They also provided examples of how this could be done, including through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), but also through sharing of information within the community and at the local level.  iii. Punish offenders and perpetrators Globally, punishing offenders and perpetrators was raised by 47% of the focus groups. The importance of punishing offenders of violence against children was slightly higher in Africa and the Americas than within Asia. For children, this call to punish offenders and perpetrators of violence against them indicates the high level of concern they face with having offenders and perpetrators living amongst them, leaving them open to re-offending. It is well documented that violence against children does not just happen in isolated cases; many children are subject to multiple forms of abuse. This reiterates the importance to the children of punishing the offenders and perpetrators so that they can feel safe from violence and exploitation.     37  iv. Guarantee access to education Access to education was identified as equally important globally as the call to raise awareness. However this was as a result of the high importance given to this topic by children within Asia where 67% of the focus groups asked world leaders to prioritize education while in Africa, 26% of the focus groups identified this as an issue. Guaranteed access to education did not come up as a top issue from children who participated in the focus groups from the Americas.  v. Other important issues Support to rights education was of particular importance for world leaders to address in both Africa and Asia but did not come up as a priority within the Americas. Addressing poverty and support to actions at the local level were of equal importance to children globally. Within Africa, there was a higher call on world leaders to address poverty, and the call to promote or support actions at the local level was highest within Asia. Children in Africa and Asia called on world leaders to support and enhance their right to participate in decisions that affect them, while this was not as high in the Americas. Globally, children recognized the need for world leaders to address create or enhance support units that provide them with direct services for both the prevention and response to violence against children. This was identified higher in Asia; however, children in all three regions did identify it as an issue. Safety and security and creation of institutions were identified equally as issues for world leaders to address. Enhancing safety and security was identified as one of the top concerns to be addressed by world leaders in the Americas but not in Africa or Asia. The creation of institutions equally, was identified by 16% of the children in Africa but not in the other regions.   Children discussing in focus group in Guinea. Photo: ChildFund Guinea.

Regional breakdown: Africa  that children are the barometer of  17-year-old boy, Guinea  When analysing the data from the focus group discussions, the top actions children wanted world leaders to take were: create and enforce legislation on violence, raise awareness on violence and exploitation, and punish offenders and perpetrators. The importance of laws and their implementation, as a key issue for world leaders to address, was prioritized by 60% of the focus groups across African countries. In Burkina Faso, children asked that the judicial powers make child rights known and respected to protect them better. The call for laws on violence against children was raised in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Liberia, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Senegal, Sierra Leone, the Gambia, Uganda and Zambia. In Kenya and Uganda, this extended to having child-friendly officers and courts. In Zambia, the recommendation to world leaders was for a judicial system that is child-friendly, especially for rural children. In the Gambia, a call to  was also made, and was echoed in Senegal, where children stressed the importance of enacting laws and regulations to protect them, but also of punishing those who break said laws and regulations.

In Burkina Faso, for example, children called for world leaders to children using their personal charisma, and in Benin, world leaders throughout the world, and demand that laws  In both cases, however, the role of local authorities in conducting awareness raising and rights education at the community level was also emphasized, and presented as complimentary to that of Governments and world leaders. In Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia and Mozambique, Togo and Mali there was specific reference for world leaders to punishing the offenders of violence against children. In Sierra Leone, children wanted to send a message to world leaders that perpetrators of violence against children, including trafficking, child marriage, rape and commercial sexual exploitation, should be treated like murder cases.       16% 16% 16% 16% 21% 26% 32% 37% 47% 53% 58% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%Create institutionsSupport and enhance child participationPromote or support actions at the local levelCreate or enhance support unitsSupport and enhance children's clubs and P2PGuarantee access to educationAddress povertySupport right's educationPunish offenders and perpetratorsRaise awareness on violence and exploitationCreate and enforce legislation against violenceActions world leaders can take - Africa   40  4.3. Regional breakdown: The Americas  should think that young people deserve to be listened to so when laws are made our opinions are taken into account and our needs  Ecuador  When analysing data from the focus group discussions in the Americas the following issues were raised as priorities for world leaders: create and enforce legislation against violence; promote or support actions at the local level; punish offenders and perpetrators, raise awareness on violence and exploitation and enhance safety and security. Children in the Americas, like children in all other regions, strongly called for world leaders to create and enforce legislation against violence. This resounding call highlights the awareness that children have of the importance not just of creating legislation but also of enforcing that legislation. Without enforcement, they will continue to face violence within their communities.  A focus group of young girls in Dominica, called on world leaders to impose bans and have penalties for people who violate children. Older girls called on world leaders to enforce laws. In Honduras, international institutions make promises but do not fulfil their duties. In Ecuador, the focus group wanted Government to listen to children when writing the laws to learn what they need and respect their rights. In the United States, the c- gun law that would allow people without permits to carry firearms as long as they are visible. The call for world leaders to promote and support efforts at the local level was highest in the Americas. The focus group in Paraguay called for world leaders to come to communities, to learn more about the issues of violence and exploitation of children and learn about their experiences. In Brazil, the participants called on world leaders to invest in education, health, social protection, local counselling, helplines and community centres, all as ways to protect them from violence and exploitation. Along with the call to enforce legislation, children in the Americas also identified the importance of punishing the perpetrators of violence against children. In one focus group, the participants were unable to think of a single case where the perpetrator was punished. In Mexico, the focus group called for abusers to go to prison. In Dominica, the call from children to world leaders was to deal with people who are perpetrators of violence against children including putting drug dealers in jail. Within the focus groups in the Americas, there were a number of calls to world leaders to not just create and enforce legislation on violence against children, but also to ensure that children themselves understand what is in that legislation. In Bolivia, participants cited several reasons for asking world leaders to ensure that they are aware of the laws. Firstly, so that they can comply with the law, but also so that they can know when violations of the law occur and can charge the abuser. In Dominica, the call was also for local consultations to take place to seek input prior to signing declarations. There were also calls for world leaders to ensure increased awareness about violence against children. These included campaigns using various information communication technologies (ICTs) and in addition, not to violate freedom of expression of citizens and the media. Participants of the focus groups in the Americas prioritized calling on world leaders to enhance safety and security, which did not occur in the other regions.   41  In many cases, the call was for police protection, including additional resources for increased police presence. One call was for leaders to destroy empty homes that draw gang activity and to increase police presence in neighbourhoods where significant violence occurs.      4.4.

What can adults do to free children from violence and exploitation?  5.1. Top issues This question was intended to learn from children what their thoughts were as to what adults, beyond world leaders, can do to free children from violence and exploitation. As stated earlier, adults must all take action to stop violence against children but the focus groups also felt that adults should see children as allies to make this happen. When answering this question, children prioritized four top issues. However, this was closely followed by five issues that were tied. This reflects the wide-ranging actions that children believe adults should be taking to protect them.    14-year-old boy, Brazil  15-year-old boy, Liberia  i. Raise awareness on violence and exploitation This was what resonated amongst the children in the majority of the focus groups as the action adults can take to free them from violence and exploitation. Some of the reasoning behind this issue being prioritized was that children felt that with this awareness, adults would be better placed to know about the violence they face and the impact it has on them. In some instances, the children acknowledged that adults had experienced violence as children and it would be through their understanding of why it was wrong that the shift towards their protection would occur. This was the number one issue for the children in Asia and the second highest for children in Africa and the Americas. ii. Support and enhance  Globally, children called on adults to support second priority.  This was tied with raising awareness in Asia. In Africa it was the fourth highest response.  However, in the Americas it was tied in fifth place alongside addressing sexual abuse, create or enhance support units, punish offenders and perpetrators, promote or support actions at the local level, engage with media and ICTs, guarantee access to healthcare, guarantee access to education and respecting c This reiterates the importance of adults listening to children and recognizing them as allies in their protection.  This was a priority for children to feel free and also a priority action for adults to take.  iii. Support parental involvement in protection Children called upon adults globally to support parental involvement in protection of children from violence and exploitation. This is in recognition of children home as a place that made them feel safe, but also a space where they experience violence.  Children recognize the important role that parents have in securing their protection from violence. Further broken down by the region, support to parental involvement in protection was the number one issue in Africa and the Americas. For children in Asia, this tied in fourth place, addressing child labour and stopping physical and humiliating punishment.     44  iv. Support and engage in rights education For children, adults taking action to support and engage in rights education will help them be free from violence and exploitation. For the children who participated in the focus groups, this issue was tied for second in both Africa and the Americas. For the children in Asia this was slightly lower at 20%.   v. Other important issues As previously identified, in response to this question, there were five additional issues that children had tied as equally important globally. These include: stop physical and humiliating punishment, create or enhance support units, promote or support actions at the local level, enforce legislation against violence and guarantee access to education. The fact that these were all equally prioritized indicates that for the children, these issues were all of importance to them.        11% 11% 13% 13% 13% 13% 13% 22% 24% 27% 29% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Respect children's rightsStop engaging in drug and substance abuseGuarantee access to educationEnforce legislation against violencePromote or support actions at the local levelCreate or enhance support unitsStop physical and humiliating punishmentSupport and engage in right's educationSupport parental involvement in protectionSupport and enhance child participationRaise awareness on violence and exploitationActions adults can take to free children from violence and exploitation - Globally   45  5.2. Regional breakdown: Africa   12-year-old girl, Zambia  12-year-old girl, Cape Verde  In the countries that participated from Africa, the number one issue raised by children was to support the role of parents in protecting children. In Zambia, this was acknowledging for them that violence and exploitation starts from a small community which is home, and, that those adults should be in the forefront to fight against violence and exploitation. Children in Zambia also identified the importance of  education on child rights and that those rights are respected. In Ghana, the children called for parents to provide the needs for children so that they are not exploited. In Guinea, children put older brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers into the category of adults who should protect them from danger. Children in Ethiopia called for a culture of openness between parents and children to protect the children from violence and exploitation. In Cape Verde, there was also a call for parents to pay more attention to the welfare of their children, while in Benin children called for parents to stop threatening their children, to stop using physical and humiliating punishment to discipline their children, and instead provide them with advice. Awareness raising among adults was identified as the second most important action adults can take to protect children against violence and exploitation. This was identified in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Gambia. In Mozambique, the reason they wanted adults to be more aware was because some adults do not know they are subjecting children to violence and exploitation, because they experienced similar situations and consider the treatment normal behaviour. In Ethiopia, children identified awareness raising amongst themselves as a key tool for their own protection. At the same time, in Burkina Faso, children recognised that different actors have different roles to play in freeing children from violence and exploitation, and highlighted the different channels through which they can take action, from parents to teachers, from civil society organisations to local authorities. The third highest priority for children in the African countries that adults can take to protect them was rights education. This was identified in Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia. In Senegal, for example, along with adults protecting them, children made the    Children participating in focus group discussion in Dominica. Photo: ChildFund Dominica.    46     5.3.

The children who participated in the five focus groups with child-led organizations in Brazil all identified the importance of parental involvement and their respect for children as the first step to creating a safe environment for children. In Guatemala, the children identified the importance of the role that parents play in the lives of boys and girls. This includes, the importance of parents being educated on violence and exploitation against children.  The focus group participants in Honduras highlighted the importance of parents not abusing them but rather providing advice and setting an example. The participants in Bolivia called on the importance of campaigns to inform parents and other adults about violence against children. In Dominica the participants called on adults to educate children on the risks and consequences of violence and exploitation. In Mexico, children called upon adults to protect them and share information but also to encourage them to report crimes. They felt that adults should inform children about violence and exploitation. In St Vincent the participants identified multiple entry points for raising awareness, including demonstrations, marches and rallies and through the media. Participants in Paraguay referred to the need for adults to be aware of the rights of children. They felt this awareness is important for adults to understand the significance of social and educational programs for children, so that they can realise their rights. 9% 9% 9% 9% 9% 11% 18% 26% 27% 27% 36% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%Guarantee access to healthcareEngage with media and ICTsPromote or support actions at the local levelPunish offenders and perpetratorsCreate or enhance support unitsStop physical and humiliating punishmentEnforce legislation against violenceSupport and enhance child participationSupport and engage in right's educationRaise awareness on violence and exploitationSupport parental involvement in protectionActions adults can take to free children from violence and exploitation - Africa   47        5.4.

What are the risks that children face? Are they different for boys and girls? What are the risks for girls? What are the risks for boys?  6.1. Top issues The purpose of this question was to identify the risks that children face in terms of violence and exploitation. Participants were also asked if they believed these risks varied according to gender, and to identify the risks for boys and for girls, accordingly. The most often cited forms of violence and exploitation faced by children were sexual violence, child labour, and physical and humiliating punishment. In response to the question about the difference in risks for boys and girls, in many focus groups children talked about the fact that both boys and girls faced similar risks of being subject to violence and exploitation. For example, child labour was raised for girls as mostly domestic labour, while for boys it was raised in the context of agriculture. At the same time, sexual violence was also seen as a violation that both boys and girls experienced. But children also recognised that boys and girls faced higher risks of particular manifestations of violence and exploitation. For example, while in many instances boys and girls were considered at risk of sexual violence, girls were seen at a higher risk when it came to commercial sexual exploitation. Harmful traditional practices, while being experienced by both girls and boys, were identified as mostly concerning girls in Africa and Asia.   15-year-old boy, Liberia  inhumanly and not considered  13-year-old girl, Nepal  When children spoke of different forms of violence and exploitation, the list for girls included, in order: sexual violence, child labour, harmful traditional practices, trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, bullying, and physical and humiliating punishment. For boys, the risks included, in order: child labour, children associated with armed forces and gangs, bullying, trafficking, sexual violence, physical and humiliating punishment and commercial sexual exploitation.          50      40% 40% 44% 47% 62% 82% 82% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%BullyingChildren associated with armed conflict and gangsHarmful traditional practicesTraffickingPhysical and humiliating punishmentChild labourSexual violenceMost cited forms of violence and exploitation for boys and girls- Globally 13% 16% 27% 33% 38% 40% 69% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%Physical and humiliating punishmentBullyingCommercial sexual exploitationTraffickingHarmful traditional practicesChild labourSexual violenceMost cited risks identified for girls - Globally   51      6.2.

Regional breakdown: The Americas In the Americas a big difference in the risks between boys and girls was not identified. For example, in the United States, boys were identified as being more at risk than girls due to being in the middle of it and the pressure to be tough and violent. In Dominica, it was felt that the best way to prevent this was to have gender appropriate spaces and services for both sexes in both private and public settings. For the boys, the preventative action was basic needs, including clothing, shoes and shelter as the issues to address the sexual exploitation of boys. In Ecuador, the focus groups identified all risks as being the same for girls and boys. In the Americas, the most cited forms of violence and exploitation for boys and girls were: sexual violence (82%); bullying, and child labour (73%); and children associated with armed conflict and gangs (55%).

Bullying meanwhile was identified for a risk for boys in Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and St Vincent.  Girls As mentioned above, in this region both boys and girls raised a number of issues. However, while sexual violence was raised by 55% in the focus groups for boys in the region it was raised by 82% for girls.

Working with partners, the aim is to they reach world leaders as they begin the process of defining the next set of global development goals.  Respondents are prompted to list the top six priorities out of sixteen that they would like to see reflected in the post-2015 development agenda. Based on their age, gender, country, and educational level, we can assess what children are prioritizing for their future. Between July and August 2013, ChildFund Alliance conducted 6,499 one-on-one interviews with children aged 10-12 in 47 countries around the world, including developed and developing nations. As part of these interviews, children were asked to take the MY World survey.     The following pages summarize the results of this exercise, illustrating what these 6,499 children aspire the next development priorities to be. It is worth noting that protection against crime and violence was globally the second most voted priority for the post-2015 development agenda, with 3,465 votes (or 53% of the votes). Furthermore, protection against crime and violence seems to be a priority for both developing and developed countries.   53% 47% Participants of My World by gender BoysGirls43% 24% 33% Proportion of My World votes between regions AfricaAmericasAsia  58           1% 6% 17% 19% 21% 25% 29% 29% 36% 37% 40% 42% 43% 44% 44% 46% 53% 65% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%No answerOtherPolitical freedomsBetter job opportunitiesPhone and internet accessBetter transport and roadsReliable energy at homeAction taken on climate changeProtecting forests, rivers and oceansAffordable and nutritious food Freedom from discrimination and persecutionAccess to clean water and sanitationBetter healthcareAn honest and responsive governmentEquality between men and womenProtection against crime and violenceA good educationChildren's priorities - MY World Total votes: 6,499 0% 3% 16% 21% 22% 23% 30% 32% 32% 35% 36% 40% 44% 45% 46% 48% 52% 72% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%No answerOtherPolitical freedomsAction taken on climate changePhone and internet accessBetter job opportunitiesProtecting forests, rivers and oceansReliable energy at homeBetter transport and roadsAffordable and nutritious foodFreedom from discrimination and persecution Equality between men and womenAccess to clean water and sanitationAn honest and responsive governmentProtection against crime and violenceBetter healthcareA good educationMY World votes in developing countries Total votes: 3,766   59           1% 10% 13% 16% 18% 21% 25% 32% 39% 40% 41% 41% 41% 46% 48% 49% 55% 61% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%No answerOtherBetter job opportunitiesBetter transport and roadsPolitical freedomsPhone and internet accessReliable energy at homeBetter healthcare An honest and responsive governmentAffordable and nutritious foodAction taken on climate changeAccess to clean water and sanitationProtecting forests, rivers and oceansEquality between men and womenFreedom from discrimination and persecutionA good educationProtection against crime and violenceMY World votes in developed countries Total votes: 2,733 0% 4% 19% 20% 23% 24% 25% 31% 32% 36% 38% 40% 41% 44% 48% 51% 57% 66% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%No answerOtherAction taken on climate changePolitical freedomsProtecting forests, rivers and oceansPhone and internet accessBetter job opportunitiesBetter transport and roadsFreedom from discrimination and persecutionReliable energy at home Equality between men and womenAn honest and responsive governmentAffordable and nutritious foodProtection against crime and violenceAccess to clean water and sanitationBetter healthcareA good educationMY World votes in Africa Total votes: 1,629   60          1% 4% 10% 15% 21% 22% 24% 29% 30% 38% 39% 41% 42% 45% 51% 52% 52% 80% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%No answerOtherPolitical freedomsPhone and internet accessAction taken on climate changeBetter job opportunitiesAffordable and nutritious foodBetter transport and roadsReliable energy at home Access to clean water and sanitationProtecting forests, rivers and oceansFreedom from discrimination and persecutionEquality between men and womenAn honest and responsive governmentProtection against crime and violenceBetter healthcareA good educationMY World votes in the Americas Total votes: 910 0% 2% 16% 23% 23% 24% 29% 30% 30% 35% 37% 42% 43% 46% 47% 48% 50% 74% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%No answerOtherPolitical freedomsAction taken on climate changeBetter job opportunitiesPhone and internet accessReliable energy at homeAffordable and nutritious foodProtecting forests, rivers and oceansBetter transport and roadsFreedom from discrimination and persecutionAccess to clean water and sanitationProtection against crime and violence Better healthcareEquality between men and womenAn honest and responsive governmentA good educationMY World votes in Asia Total votes: 1,227   61  Annex 1: Questions for focus group discussions  Principal questions Supporting questions 1.
