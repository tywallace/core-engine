[{"Global Governance": "Policy Brief #3 Recommendations on Means of Implementation in the New Global Partnership for Sustainable Development for the UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (OWG on SDGs) Additional briefs are available at http://bit.ly/OWGpolicybriefs The recommendations on means of implementation presented here have been compiled from two civil society consultations conducted by UN-NGLS in 2013: a teleconference-based consultation that resulted in the report Advancing Regional Recommendations on the Post-2015 Agenda, and an online consultation on four post-2015 reports to the Secretary-General. A list of organizations that participated in these consultations is available here. This policy brief also draws on recommendations from the consultation that UN-NGLS undertook for the Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System in 2009 and the consultation it carried out for the UN Secretary-Generals High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (AGF) in 2010. In addition, it includes elements from A Call for a Global Partnership for Just and Transformative Development in the Post-2015 Era by the CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness (CPDE). While presenting a wide range of views, this brief does not intend to represent the complete breadth of perspectives and recommendations from civil society on the subject of means of implementation1 in the new global partnership for sustainable development. Many consultation participants asserted that the adoption of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be meaningless unless strong means of implementation are in place. The post-2015 development agenda must go well beyond the limited set of means of implementation captured under Goal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) framework (a global partnership for development), and must be anchored to firm time-bound targets and objectives. Civil society networks pointed out that in practice, Goal 8 is the primary responsibility of industrialized countries, but has shown the least progress in implementation  even though this global partnership for development was supposed to create the enabling international environment to support implementation of the other MDGs. This lop-sided pattern must be reversed in the new global development framework, so that means of implementation are realized well before the target date(s) of the new substantive global goals. Questions related to means of implementation cannot be disassociated from the need to tackle the major global macroeconomic, systemic, and structural reforms required to create the truly stable and 1 As described in a UN Technical Support Team issues brief for the sixth session of the OWG on SDGs, The notion of Means of implementation describes the interdependent mix of financial resources, technology development and transfer, capacity - building, inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, as well as the creation of a national enabling environment required to implement the new sustainable development agenda, particularly in developing countries. United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 1 of 6 enabling international environment needed for the implementation of sustainable development goals. These reforms were already called for by civil society ahead of the 2010 MDG+10 Review Summit2 and are essential to accelerate progress in the achievement of the existing MDGs and to prevent major setbacks such as the 2008 food and financial crises. In the current post-crisis context of widespread practice of austerity by governments around the world, the new global partnership for development is increasingly referred to in terms of partnerships with the private sector, where private finance is expected to complement shrinking public resources. The level of investment that will be required to achieve the global transition to sustainable development is unprecedented and will far exceed the non-binding goal set by developed countries in the 2009 UNFCCC Copenhagen Accord to mobilize US $100 billion a year by 2020 for climate change mitigation. The US $100 billion goal itself is widely viewed as arbitrary and inadequate for meeting the financing needs for climate mitigation. In debates about climate and sustainable development finance, it is often proposed that private sources must be tapped to generate long-term stable and affordable finance. Civil society consultation contributors emphasized, however, that the private sector cannot be expected to support the transition to sustainable development on a purely voluntary basis, and only strong, democratically- defined public policies (including new laws and regulations) can steer public and private investments on the scale and with the predictability required to manage the transition. A number of safeguards must be put in place to ensure that public-private partnerships support and do not undermine sustainable development and human rights. Just as importantly, the new development agenda must call for the mobilization of new and innovative sources of public finance, and must limit undue losses. This will require: new international taxes; global rules to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations contribute their fair share of taxes; and equitable treatment between debtors and creditors in the face of recurring sovereign debt crises, which have caused major regressions in human rights. To be effective, the post-2015 agenda must also include much stronger accountability measures to ensure delivery on commitments. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be respected, taking into account the historical responsibilities of industrialized countries. Lack of accountability has enabled developed countries to shirk their long-standing commitment to contribute 0.7% of annual gross domestic income to official development assistance (ODA); this global development partnership commitment, which dates back to 1970, is still widely unfulfilled and must be met unconditionally. The new development framework must also prioritize greater domestic resource mobilization. Much can be done in this regard at country level, but international cooperation is also required to overcome systemic flaws that prevent or discourage countries from taking bold progressive tax measures on their own. Detailed recommendations from civil society consultation participants are presented below, organized according to the following six objectives: 1. Reform the international financial architecture; 2. Reform the international tax architecture; 3. Reform the international development and climate finance architecture; 2 See Reports of the UN-NGLS Consultation and Informal Interactive Hearings of the General Assembly with non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, and the private sector in preparation for the 2010 MDG+10 Summit. United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 2 of 6 4. Reform the international trade and investment architecture; 5. Adopt strong safeguards in the implementation of public-private partnerships; and 6. Increase domestic resource mobilization. 1. Reform the international financial architecture a) Improve financial regulation, including through the use of capital controls, and reverse the financialization of the economy in a manner that allows for a sustained shift of resources from the financial economy back to the real economy, prioritizing employment-intensive, low-carbon, and low-resource intensive production. b) Prioritize support to micro-, medium, community-based, and cooperative enterprises, where the overwhelming majority of jobs around the world are created, notably through measures such as national and international guarantee funds, grants, and highly concessional long-term loans. c) Rein in the power of too big to fail institutions through enforceable national and international regulations that would sanction them as too big to allow, and implement a range of measures to prevent the socialization of the costs of corporate wrongdoing. d) Regulate food and commodities markets to curb price volatility, while rendering illegal any high- yielding financial instruments that lack social purpose. e) Address the problem of unsustainable debt, including by: i) reviewing onerous debts and cancelling those deemed illegitimate; ii) prioritizing resources for meeting development goals and human rights obligations over debt repayments, especially in Least Developed Countries (LDCs); iii) establishing an independent and fair debt arbitration court that can provide a single statutory framework for debt crisis resolution by ensuring that both creditors and debtors cooperate to restructure sovereign debt, while taking into account the unique economic conditions of debtor countries; and (iv) preventing human rights violations during a debt crisis by declaring a debt standstill and pursuing counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies (with international assistance if needed) rather than austerity measures. f) Reform and democratize international financial institutions to ensure that they: i) give much greater voice to developing countries, particularly LDCs; ii) genuinely respond to national and regional circumstances and priorities; iii) catalyze productive investments, including in clean production systems; and iv) abide by the international human rights obligations of States. g) Limit exchange rate volatility, notably by developing and implementing an effective regulatory system for countries and blocks of countries that issue reserve currencies, and transitioning from overdependence on the US dollar in international transactions towards a supranational reserve currency  with revamped Special Drawing Rights as a proxy leading towards such currency. h) Promote new financial and monetary architectures at the regional level, by: i) establishing regional monetary funds that would pool foreign currency reserves to combat speculative attacks and to compensate for economic asymmetries within the region; ii) extending intra-regional trade through regional complementary currencies; and iii) establishing or consolidating regional development banks that finance transformative objectives in alignment with the realization of economic, social, and cultural rights and environmental regeneration. i) Foster inter-regional learning on best practices for new regional financial and monetary architectures, drawing especially on such experiences from Latin America. 2. Reform the international tax architecture a) Implement financial transaction taxes regionally and at the global level. United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 3 of 6 b) Agree internationally to automatic exchange of information of bank holdings, country-by-country reporting of transnational corporations (TNCs), and the closing of tax havens, as indispensable measures to prevent tax avoidances and enable progressive redistributive taxes; upgrade the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters to an intergovernmental body. c) Adopt regional and global agreements to reverse the race to the bottom in national tax concessions to foreign corporations, which may extend to prevent other perverse incentives, such as weakening labour and environmental standards to attract foreign investments. 3. Reform the international development and climate finance architecture a) Refrain from treating foreign direct investment (FDI) as a substitute for ODA; the long-standing commitment of developed countries to dedicate 0.7% of gross domestic income to ODA should be met unconditionally. Implement a new rights-based approach of financial transfers beyond ODA in the form of a mandatory system, a fiscal equalization scheme, or a compensation scheme, to pay off climate debt and other forms of ecological debt. b) Conclude a fair, ambitious, and binding international climate change agreement, which should include a finance package that primarily focuses on non-market mechanisms to address climate change and ensure that developed countries provide the required funds and technology to developing countries, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. c) Make a legally binding commitment to provide climate finance at a much higher level than the developed countries goal of mobilizing jointly US$100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of climate change mitigation, as pledged in the 2009 UNFCCC Copenhagen Accord.3 d) Ensure that climate finance is balanced between mitigation and adaptation, and that adaptation projects  for both practical and ethical reasons  are funded by grants rather than loans, so that they do not place onerous debt burdens upon developing countries, particularly the LDCs and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), who have contributed the least to climate change4 but are the most vulnerable to climate disasters. e) Activate the use of Special Drawing Rights as an innovative source of development and climate finance. 4. Reform the international trade and investment architecture a) Review international trade and investment agreements, which restrict the ability of governments to regulate foreign investments in the public interest, impose barriers to technology transfer, prevent fair taxation, and inconsistent with the objectives of sustainable development. include other measures b) Address the problem of excessive concentration of corporate power, such as global cartels that stifle innovation and crowd out alternative initiatives, notably by developing international anti-trust laws and institutions and by reinstating the equivalent of the former UN Centre on Transnational Corporations  an independent entity to monitor TNCs and help ensure that States respect their commitments to regulate them. 3 This Accord was drafted by only five countries and was not adopted by delegates; it was merely noted. Civil society widely views the US $100 billion goal as arbitrary and far below what science and equity demands to address climate change. 4 According to the Global Humanitarian Forum Human Impact Report (2009), The 50 least developed countries contribute less than 1% of global carbon emissions. This finding is supported by annual data for carbon dioxide emissions per country available from the UN Statistics Division. United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 4 of 6 c) Ensure that the trade architecture provides the flexibility for developing countries to adopt trade, public procurement, and other policies to protect and promote the livelihoods of small producers, achieve food security, ensure access to affordable medicines and technology, and foster nascent domestic industries, including by giving Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) serious weight, operationalization, and legal status for developing countries in the next phase of negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO). d) Phase out agricultural and fisheries subsidies in developed countries that harm the livelihoods of farmers and fisherfolk in developing countries. for e) Rapidly close the implementation gap of the technology transfer commitments laid out in Agenda 21 of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development and the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, and reaffirmed in the outcome document of the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, which underlined the need for enabling environments transfer of environmentally sound technologies, notably through foreign direct investments, international trade, and international cooperation (paragraph 271). In this regard, adopt new flexibilities in the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and the local content requirements restrictions in the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), to accelerate the transfer of clean technologies to developing countries; repeal any provisions (including so-called WTO plus provisions) in bilateral and regional trade and investment treaties that stand in the way of accelerating the transfer of affordable clean technology to developing countries. the development, adaption, dissemination and f) 5. Adopt strong safeguards in the implementation of public-private partnerships a) Ensure that international and national financing partnerships with the private sector are subject to mandatory accountability safeguards to ensure that financing is allocated to businesses that are creating decent work and contributing to the expansion of the domestic tax base rather than tax evasion. Ensure that criteria related to equitable distribution and affordability  and not only to access  are met; further ensure that these safeguards prevent the socialization of costs in the case these projects fail. b) Frame partnerships with the private sector within the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework (adopted by the UN Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in 2011), and supplement these principles with binding enforcement measures, including legislation, court adjudication, and penalties for violations. c) Respect, protect, and promote social and environmental justice and human rights, including by complementing the provisions of the Declaration on the Right to Development. The rights of communities affected by projects, particularly marginalized and Indigenous peoples, must never be violated for development. Ensure democratic control of natural resources. d) Create multi-stakeholder governance structures, ensuring equitable and inclusive representation that promotes gender equality and includes members of civil society and affected communities. Ensure that respective stakeholder groups, rather than a Secretariat or other management entity of the partnership, nominate representatives to partnership bodies. Prohibit corporations and their interest groups from having undue influence over agenda-setting and political decision-making by governments. Identify and design projects through bottom up processes that include affected citizens and empower historically marginalized people to participate. f) Clearly define the roles and responsibilities for each partner; while doing so, prioritize public e) United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 5 of 6 delivery of services, which has historically and consistently best served the public interest. g) Ensure that the public sector does not incur unsustainable debts and fiscal commitments (including contingent liabilities) that compromise its capacity to serve diverse needs of its people. h) Adopt ethical guidelines that address any real, perceived, or potential conflicts of interest. i) Enhance the key development effectiveness principle of country ownership. Ensure that sustainable development policy and implementation is in line with country priorities and national contexts, with expertise sourced through transparent and inclusive processes that are gender balanced and involve affected communities, particularly Indigenous peoples. Increase Domestic Resource Mobilization In some cases, the following measures need to be backed by enabling international policies and rules outlined above to be fully effective in a context of globalized financial markets and unrestricted corporate capital movements. Implement progressive taxation measures on wealthier companies and individuals, and reverse regressive tax measures, such as high value-added taxes (VATs), especially on essential products; ensure that progressive tax reform takes into consideration the impact of tax codes on human rights, especially of the more vulnerable groups. b) Phase out subsidies that support unsustainable production and consumption patterns and redirect these large amounts of resources to fund sustainable development, while ensuring that poorer income groups are not negatively affected by these measures. c) Adopt targets to shift government resources away from military spending and towards social 6. a) spending. d) Include in the Sustainable Development Goals domestic resource mobilization targets related to: i) progressive taxation; ii) corporate taxation; and iii) increasing the ratio of tax revenue to Gross Domestic Product, recognizing that countries have different starting points and ensuring that middle and low-income groups are not negatively affected. United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service (UN-NGLS) www.un-ngls.org Policy Brief #3 Page 6 of 6 Good Governance and Extreme Poverty INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT ATD FOURTH WORLD Governance in the context of extreme poverty Effective governance, at whatever geographical or political level, cannot be brought about while extreme poverty exists. All thought and discussion on governance must begin by examining how to reintegrate all people, without exception, into the social dialogues which take place within communities, as well as both nationally and internationally. Extreme poverty has been defined as the combination of income poverty, human development poverty and social exclusioni, where a prolonged lack of basic security affects several aspects of peoples lives simultaneously, severely compromising their chances of exercising or regaining their rights and of reassuming their responsibilities in the foreseeable future.ii By its very definition, extreme poverty is an obstacle to the active citizenship which effective governance requires. Among the consequences of extreme poverty is the associated isolation and exclusion, exacerbated by a sense of shame and stigma.iii As a participant with experience of poverty in a peer-review project explained, \"The challenge for me is the isolation, the loneliness, the painful awareness that we are not able to join in society or play any part in it.\"iv Extreme poverty, above and beyond social needs or deprivations, equates to the negation of all social existence due to the impossibility of full enjoyment of fundamental human rights  social, economic and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights. Its endurance is testament that respect of human rights is an obligation that is not applied to all people, since some are seen as \"hopeless cases\". The fact that extreme poverty is first and foremost a human rights violation means that any attempt to build effective governance, based on respect for humans and the ethics of responsibility, must first seek its eradication.v The Millennium Declaration resolved to \"To strive for the full protection and promotion in all our countries of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for all\" with the goal of \"freeing the entire human race from want.\" Yet it is apparent that progress has been uneven in achieving the MDGs, both between and within countries, most notably for the very poorest and most marginalised people and populations.vi The consequences of non-effective governance in the context of extreme poverty challenges for a post-MDG framework Effective governance is difficult to attain when those most affected by extreme poverty have trouble getting their voices heard and their interests taken into account by service providers and decision makers. Globally, public expenditure on health, education and sanitation benefit the non-poor far more than the poor, who are powerless to change the situation.vii This powerlessness, when compounded by shame, lack of self-confidence and the fear of meeting others stemming from being on the receiving end of contempt from an early age, exacerbates the exclusion experienced by people in extreme poverty. As one participant in a recent participatory research project explained: Extreme poverty engenders a fear, a shame in people, doubts that Contact: Cristina Diez cristina.diez@atd-fourthworld.org stop them from expressing themselves when they should.viii This renders effective, fully inclusive governance, highly problematic. Participatory research carried out with people experiencing chronic poverty has suggested that encounters with public services were perceived to be associated with the risk of losing resources, being misunderstood, harshly judged or penalised. Research participants felt that the humiliation, lack of respect and contempt they faced could be seen as a form of violence, an attack on their identity as a member of society or of the community, and a denial of their individual humanity. The barriers this created made mutual recognition, understanding and communication impossible.ix The idea that people living in poverty are unworthy of the rights, benefits and aid to which they are fully entitled has a corrosive effect on the quality and fairness of governance at a local and national level. The promotion of effective governance is exacerbated by the difficulties of very marginalised populations to hold governments, as well as service providers from all sectors, to account. In the context of international development, this absence of accountability risks creating projects or programmes intended to achieve poverty eradication goals that are ill-adapted to the needs of those experiencing the most extreme poverty. This stems from a limited and incomplete understanding of the realities of people living in extreme poverty. Donors all to often demand quick fix solutions, whilst exhibiting a naive approach regarding the social impact of the projects they oversee, and a voluntary blindness about true levels of project accountability. Staff are reluctant or unable to invest the time necessary to seek out the voices of the most impoverished.x This makes it increasingly difficult for projects and programmes to tackle extreme poverty. If only the most enterprising members of the community are reached, inequalities may in fact be entrenched, furthering the exclusion of the most vulnerable community members.xi Crucial to effective governance is ensuring the fundamental social bonds that link the individual to society. It is therefore vital to recognise and reinforce the social and family ties which the most marginalised people and families use to resist the shocks inherent with the experience of extreme povertyxii. When humanitarian or development projects and services fail to recognise their importance, these ties are at risk of being undermined  even unintentionally  which can in turn lead to the rupture of this form of resistance and divide the poorest communities, leaving their inhabitants further susceptible to extreme poverty.xiii Fair and effective governance also relies on an active and informed citizen body. Active citizenship not only reinforces social bonds, but also encourages accountability and transparency and protects fundamental rights. However, in many countries people living in extreme poverty are unable to play their roles as active citizens. Barriers to citizenship include the cost of official documents, such as identity papers and birth certificates, high levels of illiteracy amongst the most marginalised communities and reluctance amongst local officials to acknowledge populations living in informal settlements. People living in extreme poverty also report that the lack of information about their rights as citizens also affects their ability to play an active role in civic society. Further problems are posed by the prejudicial views held by administrators and public officials about the intelligence, ability and motivation of impoverished individuals and communities.xiv Addressing the challenges of effective governance from a human rights perspective Effective governance can only be achieved if all citizens are able to attain full and effective enjoyment of all fundamental rights. For this reason, it is essential that a post-2015 framework conforms to recognised human rights norms and standards and considers sustainable development within the context of meeting human rights obligations. The advantages of such an approach for effective governance are manifold. A human rights Contact: Cristina Diez cristina.diez@atd-fourthworld.org approach is based on equity, non-discrimination and universalism. Priority is afforded to the members of society who encounter the most obstacles in achieving their rights. A human rights approach also stresses the principle of the participation of those affected to be actively involved as rights holders in addressing their situation. It encourages duty bearers to involve people in extreme poverty as citizens with knowledge to offer in finding solutions, which, as a result of their active participation, are more likely to be effective. Of course, the necessary conditions must be met for such participation to be meaningful and genuinely serve poverty eradication efforts. The recently adopted UN Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights provide a practical tool for policy makers in designing their public policies, particularly their poverty eradication efforts. Based on international human rights norms and values, the Principles provide guidance on the application of States human rights obligations in the fight against extreme poverty. They highlight the specific rights whose enjoyment by persons living in poverty are particularly limited and obstructed, and in relation to which State policies are often inadequate or counterproductive.xv The Guiding Principles also clearly outline the barriers that people living in extreme poverty face in claiming their rights, and give detailed steps of ways by which state - as well as non-state actors  can counteract them. Given that they are based on agreed human rights norms and standards, they provide a common basis for dialogue between rights holders and duty bearers. By also providing specific implementation requirements, they provide a clear framework for stakeholders seeking to promote effective governance through the implementation of Human Rights. Promoting participatory good governance in the post-2015 development framework Families and individuals living in extreme poverty aspire to play an active role in creating effective and fair forms of governance. Ensuring their ability to genuinely participate all forms of governance, from international institutions to groups responsible for overseeing local development projects, is extremely important. Their participation not only counteracts the stigmatisation faced by impoverished communities, but also improves the impact and sustainability of the policies and programmes designed to address their needs and encourage development. The following recommendations, created in partnership with people living in extreme poverty,xvi aim to counteract the challenges that extreme poverty poses to the maintenance of fair and effective forms of government:  Ensure transparency at all levels of governance whilst creating accountability mechanisms at national and international levels. The reason decisions are taken and the effects of participation must be clear for all to see. Independent ombudsmen, judicial processes and peer-review systems between countries can all help ensure that participatory governance is not just tokenistic.  Develop participatory mechanisms at all levels of governance, in line with the provisions set out in the Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights: States must ensure the active, free, informed and meaningful participation of persons living in poverty at all stages of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of decisions and policies affecting them Particular care should be taken to fully include the poorest and most socially excluded persons.  Ensure that local, national and international structures encourage participatory governance. The incentives for staff in local, national and international institutions and administrations should be modified to make their governance processes more conducive to implementing participatory approaches. Contact: Cristina Diez cristina.diez@atd-fourthworld.org  Enable impoverished communities to participate meaningfully in governance. Participation cannot be imposed, and time must be taken to listen to entire communities, not just community 'leaders'. Building the capacity of communities to self-organise and build links with wider society should be a priority. The role of CSOs that provide space for people living in poverty to speak with their own voices and take part in decision-making processes should be recognised. i UN Human Rights Council. (2008).

Leisinger, Chairman Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development M. Peter Bakker, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 16 January 2013 Introduction: The scale and complexity of the sustainable development challenges of our Planet are such, that it is clear that no single group of actors or institutions can make a decisive difference. Game-changing progress towards sustainable development demands a multi-stakeholder approach. The international community, multi-lateral institutions, national governments, academia, civil society and business have got to work together towards a common agenda. Within the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), Business will play a role in almost all of the 12 identified thematic working groups. The innovations, management skills and financial resources of Business will be a major provider of solutions to most areas. In the 12th thematic working group we will develop suggestions for the role of Business in the transition towards a sustainable economy. This paper outlines the direction of our working group under the following headings: A) B) C) D) E) Within the space of sustainable development the Role of Business working group will take the following elements into account: 1. How to incentivize and support sustainable economic development, 2. How to ensure that future economic growth and technological progress aim to be socially inclusive, achieving poverty eradication, youth unemployment reductions and more equal societies, The state of the art of responsible business, The required (r)evolution in the role of business or long-term pathway to Sustainability, The mechanisms to scale up solutions, The link between SDGs and Business The action agenda for the Role of Business working group. 3. How to achieve environmental sustainability, aimed at developing low carbon solutions, reducing stress on all Planetary Boundaries as well as scaling up resource productivity and agricultural improvements, 4. How to ensure good governance, which is essential for sustainable development. This applies to national and international governments as well as to corporate governance. The state of the art of responsible business: A) Twenty years ago - in the first Rio summit - business had only a very marginal presence. Twenty years later a lot has changed. The awareness for sustainability in business has increased; an ever larger group of businesses is joining the standard for responsible business that is defined by the principles of the UN Global Compact; leading companies are integrating sustainability in the core of their strategies and more and more business solutions for a sustainable world are developed. Partnerships with the UN and other elements of civil society are now considered normal and so is business representation in major meetings. Business has traditionally focused on providing goods and services that meet customer demands, can be sold at competitive prices, in a profitable way, while adhering to law and regulation. Successful entrepreneurship is the most important driver of economic growth and hence improvement of living standards. However in a world that is resource constraint; where climate change is now clearly linked to human activity and where growth has so far been unable to include all citizens on our planet, this traditional role of business is not good enough to achieve a sustainable world. Nor can it be expected that - without any additional intervention - entrepreneurship will be able to solve all our challenges. 1 Over 10.000 corporate participants worldwide have joined the UN Global Compact, through which its ten principles have de facto become the standard for \"responsible business behavior\". An expansion of these principles is developed in the LEAD initiative of the Global Compact where companies are encouraged to undertake more outward oriented actions to increase their positive impact in society. Examples of such actions:  Pursue social investments and philanthropic contributions that tie in with the core competences or operating context of the company  Coordinate with other organizations and initiatives to amplify efforts  Strive for partnerships with UN entities, governments, NGO's and industry peers. WBCSD - a group of 200 forward thinking companies - developed a Vision 2050, which outlines a pathway to reach a sustainable global society by 2050, in which the earths 9 billion people live well and within the limits of the planet. The pathway will enable us to live within the limits of one planet limiting the destruction of key ecosystem services  including climate, forest, fisheries and farmlands  and easing human hardship through inclusive growth. The most progressive companies have begun a full integration of sustainability in the operations and strategy of business, not as social investment or philanthropic contribution, but integrated in the strategy and operations of its core business. B) In Vision 2050 a call for a new agenda for business is included: to work with government and society worldwide to transform markets and competition. Prices must be rationalized to include such externalities as key ecosystem services so that sustainability can become a true competitive advantage across all industries and regions. Such pricing of externalities will also allow more conscious consumer choices and support the launch and sales of more sustainable products and services. The transformation that capitalism has to go through to align with a sustainable development of the economy will not be achieved through mere incremental change, but requires a radical transformation of the way markets work. Like every journey, such transformation will most likely happen in a numbers of steps: 1. More companies are to be inspired to not do harm and compete with integrity and sign up The required (r)evolution in the role of business or long-term pathway to Sustainability: to the UN Global Compact standards for responsible behavior; and report their sustainability performance annually. Through partnerships and strategic philanthropy the positive impact on society by companies can be further enlarged 2. Companies should be integrating sustainability in their core-business strategies so that their core business becomes the engine of solutions for the challenges in the social and environmental impact of their business and products. Solutions that are reality-based will take of first. These have viable business cases today as a result of lower costs (fuel efficiency etc) or new business (sales) opportunities. Additionally an exploration of quick bold simple remedies for the most pressing sustainability challenges that can buy us time will be in this step as well. 3. Business and capital markets need to formalize the way that sustainability challenges are reflected in the long-term risk assessment of a company. It is important that these risk- 2 assessments are well-grounded in the scientific outlook on social and environmental boundaries. 4. The last step is systemic change aimed at creating a better way to measure and value the true performance of business. It seems now clear that change will not be sufficient if business, or the capital markets supporting it, will continue to only focus on a (short-term) return on financial capital. Business uses not only financial capital, but also natural capital (resources, ecosystems) and social capital (humans) and must begin to optimize the returns of business in a balanced way across all three of these capitals, recognizing that all three capitals have a cost of capital associated with them. The most progressed example of this true costing has been implemented by Puma in its E- P&L, in which all ecological impacts throughout its value chain were measured, monetized and taken as a charge against its financial profit. The E-P&L is now being developed to more sectors and geographies through a newly launched initiative, called the B-team. Other initiatives like IIRC (Integrated Reporting), TEEB for Business, GRI and SASB will develop the concept of pricing externalities for inclusion in the accounting framework of business. Using pricing as a mechanism to come to better (business and consumer) decisions and valuations is relatively well-developed for key elements of Natural Capital. However some significant hurdles for implementation remain in stranded assets and re-alignment of the tax systems. When it comes to including Social Capital in the way business will manage its performance and impact on societies, the tools and methods are generally more scattered and less developed. Within SDSN the link to the academic world will be used to make progress in this field towards standards that can be linked to and support the SDG achievements The Mechanisms to scale up solutions: C) Business has and will be the major provider of solutions for many of the sustainability challenges. New technologies will bring alternative solutions forward, new business models will emerge and continued close cooperation with governments will bring regulations that will incentivize the development and deployment of new solutions and behavior. In generic terms there are five ways that - if embedded within an incentivizing framework of public policies - will allow for fast scaling up of business solutions:  Get more companies into sustainability:  encourage more companies to accept the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (do not harm and compete with integrity) andencourage more companies to partner with the UN entities and other NGOs (strategic philanthropy),  communicate why sustainability makes good business sense (the business case).  Get leading companies to do more:  share the best practices of the leading companies to further enhance the business case for sustainability (story telling), inspire the leading companies to push the boundaries of innovation.   Sector based solutions:  share best practices within each sector,  elevate the best practices to the standard of operation for the sector. 3  Cross-sector innovation:  bring leading companies from different sectors together to create innovative solutions for complex system challenges (like cities, buildings, water nexus etc.),  develop indexes for ranking these solutions to encourage speed of implementation (i.e. sustainable city index).  Systemic changes:  develop the universal accounting and valuation framework for balancing financial, social and natural capital,  develop the curriculum for future business leaders education. Even though the scaling mechanisms above are all business based solutions, it remains of pivotal importance to state that only through close collaboration aimed at aligning the objectives of all actors (governments, civil society and academia), the full impact can be achieved. In this context is important that SDSN also reviews opportunities where governments can better tap into the financing, innovation and expertise from the private sector. Within the SDSN working group on the Role of Business each of the solutions coming out of the other working groups will be reviewed against the above mentioned scale-up mechanisms, in order to recommend actions by business and public policies for accelerated implementation. D) The HLP and other UN processes are moving towards the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals, that ought to apply to all actors in society including Business. For Business to be truly engaged it is important to create a framework for the translation of the SDGs in a way that the required business contributions become quantified, actionable and time-bound. Furthermore it could be considered to create some SDGs that specifically target behavior and or contribution of Business. The SDSN Role of Business working group can offer the following support in the creating this framework:  SDGs could include specific targets for number of companies to sign-up to principles of The link between the SDGs and Business: do no harm and compete with integrity,  SDGs can be aimed to be implemented through specific partnerships between Business and UN entities. SDSN could work with the UN Office for Partnerships to create specific proposals,  Each SDG should be broken down to relevant Business sectors and regions so they can provide solution for the achievement of that goal. Each sector should be invited to make proposals for the (social, environmental, economic and governance) contribution specific to that sector and the SDG.  For each of the SDGs a specific set of measurement tools should be reviewed so that Business can include these in their management information systems that drive actions towards achievement, 4  A specific SDG for the transformation of markets to include pricing of externalities for both Natural and Social Capital could be considered as a way to accelerate acceptance of these concepts. The action agenda for the Role of Business working group: E) As is clear from the paragraphs above the SDSN Role of Business working group will focus on the following elements:   detailing of the long-term pathway to Sustainability through Business solutions, creating recommendations for scaling up all business solutions recommendations out of all SDSN working groups, creation of a framework to translate the SDGs into actionable, quantified and time- bound objectives for business contributions.  Next to these main topics the working group will review the impact of a number of other topics:  responsible advertising aimed at promoting more responsible product choices by existing customers as well as the creation of a more sustainable lifestyle in emerging markets, responsible lobbying that will ensure companies do not lobby against positions that they express in their sustainability or general business strategies, responsible tax optimization code that will review possibilities to eliminate unfair tax avoidance, review of first-mover incentive mechanisms.    5", "Decarbonization": "pathways to deep decarbonization interim report 2014 Disclaimer SDSN IDDRI The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) is convened under the auspices of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI).

In particular, the authors would like to thank the Leadership Council of the SDSN, the members of the SDSN, as well as the National and Regional SDSNs that have discussed the implications of deep decarbonization for their countries and regions. The report has also benefited from the advice of the Thematic Groups of the SDSN. We are very grateful for the technical advice and encouragement received from the outstanding team at the International Energy Agency, led by its Chief Economist Fatih Birol. Under the leadership of Peter Bakker many members of the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and its national chapters have provided valuable advice to the DDPP teams, particularly on technologies for deep decarbonization. The report has also greatly benefited from discussions with the New Climate Economy Commission, which will publish its report in September 2014. The DDPP is grateful for generous financial support received from many supporters, including the Childrens Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the German Environment Ministry, the Gross Family Foundation, The European Climate Foundation (ECF), Agence de l'Environnement et de la Matrise de l'nergie (ADEME), IDDRI, and the SDSN. Many others have provided direct assistance to individual Country Research Teams. Critical support in the preparation of this report was provided by Pierre Barthlemy, Claire Bulger, Jessica Moreira, Ivan Pharabod, Rebecca Sopchik, Lna Spinazz, Elana Sulakshana, Erin Trowbridge, and Kathy Zhang. The authors of the DDPP are pleased to present this interim 2014 report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on July 8, 2014 in advance of the UN Climate Leaders Summit that he will convene in New York on September 23, 2014. We thank the Secretary-General for his unwavering support for the SDSN and the DDPP as well as his global leadership on the decisive issue of preventing dangerous climate change. Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Deutsche Gesellschaft fr iii iv v The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) is a collaborative initiative to understand and show how individual countries can transition to a low-carbon economy and how the world can meet the internationally agreed target of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius (C). Achieving the 2C limit will require that global net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) approach zero by the second half of the century. This will require a profound transformation of energy systems by mid-century through steep declines in carbon intensity in all sectors of the economy, a transition we call deep decarbonization. Currently, the DDPP comprises 15 Country Research Teams composed of leading researchers and research institutions from countries representing 70% of global GHG emissions and different stages of development: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. The Country Research Teams are acting independently of governments and do not necessarily reflect the positions or views of their national governments. Each DDPP Country Research Team is developing a pathway analysis for deep decarbonization. We expect the number of Country Research Teams to grow over the coming months and years. Several Partner Organizations contribute to the analysis and outreach of the DDPP, including the German Development Institute (GDI), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD). We invite other organizations to become DDPP partners and contribute to practical problem solving for deep decarbonization. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) co-founded and lead the DDPP. The DDPP is an ongoing initiative that will issue periodic reports on deep decarbonization. The DDPP is issuing this interim 2014 report to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in support of the Climate Leaders Summit at the United Nations on September 23, 2014. The interim 2014 report describes the DDPPs approach to deep decarbonization at the country level and presents preliminary findings on technically feasible pathways to deep decarbonization. As underscored throughout this report, the results of the DDPP analyses remain preliminary and incomplete. Additional country chapters1 will be published in the coming weeks. The complete 2014 DDPP report will be issued ahead of the Climate Leaders Summit in September 2014. In the meantime, the DDPP welcomes comments and suggestions on this draft to be sent to info@unsdsn.org and iddri@iddri.org before August 15, 2014. In the first half of 2015, the DDPP will issue a more comprehensive report to the French Government, host of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 2015 DDPP report will refine the analysis of the technical 1 This interim 2014 DDPP report includes 12 country chapters. The remaining 3 (Brazil, India and Germany) will be put online at deepdecarbonization.org in the coming weeks and included in the complete 2014 report to be published in September. vi decarbonization potential, exploring options for even deeper decarbonization, but also better taking into account existing infrastructure stocks. At this stage, we have not yet looked in detail at the issue of the costs and benefits of mitigation actions, nor considered the question of who should pay for these costs. The 2015 DDPP report will take a broader perspective, and go beyond technical feasibility, to analyze in further detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches, identify national and international financial requirements, and map out policy frameworks for implementation. We hope that the Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDPs) outlined in this report and the ongoing analytical work by the Country Research Teams will support discussions in every country on how to achieve deep decarbonization. Above all, we hope that the findings will be helpful to the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as they craft a strong agreement on climate change mitigation at the COP-21 in Paris in December 2015. vii Taking the 2C Limit Seriously ......................................................................................... 1 Staying within the 2C limit: the solemn responsibility of the global community ........................ 1 Business as usual means catastrophic climate change is likely .................................................. 2 Even a 2C increase in global temperatures entails major risks .................................................. 3 Why the world needs to stick to the 2C limit .............................................................................. 3 How to pursue the 2C limit seriously .......................................................................................... 4 Chapter I. 1.1. 1.2. 1.3. 1.4. 1.5.

The DDPP is a knowledge network comprising 15 Country Research Teams and several Partner Organizations who develop and share methods, assumptions, and findings related to deep decarbonization. Each DDPP Country Research Team develops illustrative pathway analysis for the transition to a low-carbon economy, with the intent of taking into account national socio-economic conditions, development aspirations, infrastructure stocks, resource endowments, and other relevant factors. The interim 2014 report focuses on technically feasible pathways to deep decarbonization. This executive summary starts with a short outline of key results from previous global studies (discussed in chapter I to IV) and then turns to what is new and special about the country-level approach of the DDPP (explained in chapter V). It summarizes the main preliminary findings from the Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDPs) developed by the Country Research Teams (included in chapter VI) and draws some lessons for the international negotiations leading up to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Paris in December 2015. The economic, social, and environmental risks of unabated climate change are immense. They threaten to roll back the fruits of decades of growth and development, undermine prosperity, and jeopardize countries ability to achieve even the most basic socio-economic development goals in the future, including the eradication of poverty and continued economic growth. These risks affect all developed and developing countries alike. Avoiding dangerous climate change and achieving sustainable development are inextricably linked. There is no prospect of winning the fight against climate change if countries fail on poverty eradication or if countries do not succeed in raising the living standards of their people. Addressing climate change requires deep emission reductions of all greenhouse gases (GHGs), including the deep decarbonization of energy systems. To be successful, this transition must ensure that socio-economic development needs are met within the constraints of very low emissions. The results from previous global studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports (AR), show that deeply reducing GHG emissions and achieving socio-economic development are not mutually exclusive. Robust economic growth and rising prosperity are consistent with the objective of deep decarbonization. They form two sides of the same coin and must be pursued together as part of sustainable development. The DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams assume continued, sometimes rapid, economic growth. The forthcoming report from the Global Commission on the New Climate Economy provides additional insights on how to pursue these twin objectives. xi In 2010, all governments operationalized the objective of the UNFCCC to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by adopting the target of keeping the global rise in mean surface temperature below 2C compared with the pre-industrial average. They did this in recognition of the extreme risks to future human wellbeing resulting from a rise in temperature above 2C. The latest scientific research analyzed by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Working Group 2 (WG2) concludes that even an increase in global temperatures of 2C constitutes a serious threat to human wellbeing. Keeping below 2C of global warming is indispensable to maintain climate change within the boundaries of manageable risks and to our ability to adapt to climate change. Limiting the increase in global mean temperature to less than 2C imposes a tough constraint on cumulative GHG emissions, including CO2 emissions, which are the largest single source (76%) of GHG emissions. To have a likely chancedefined as a probability higher than two-thirdsof staying within this limit, the level of cumulative CO2 emissions from land use, fossil fuels, and industry must be in the range of 550-1300 billion tons (Gigatons or Gt) by mid-century. If one excludes a significant contribution from net negative emissions,3 the CO2 budget to 2050 is 825 Gt. Staying within this CO2 budget requires very near-term peaking and a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions thereafter, especially in energy-related CO2 emissions. The scenarios reviewed by the IPCC that give a likely chance of staying within the 2C limit project CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes (CO2-energy emissions) close to 11 Gt in 2050 on average (down from 34 Gt in 2011). The IEA Energy Technology Perspective (ETP) 2C scenario (2DS), which gives only a 50% chance of staying within the 2C limit, reaches 15 Gt CO2-energy in 2050. Assuming a world population of 9.5 billion people by 2050in line with the medium fertility forecast of the UN Population Divisionthis means that countries would need to converge close to a global average of CO2-energy emissions per capita of 1.6 tons in 2050, which is a sharp decrease compared to today's global average of 5.2 tons, especially for developed countries with current emissions per capita much higher than today's global average. The world is not on track to stay within the 2C limit. While awareness of climate change is rising, and a large and growing number of countries, cities, and corporations have pledged to reduce their GHG emissions, these pledges taken together are not sufficient to stay within the 2C limit. The IPCC AR5 Working Group 3 (WG3) calculates that in the absence of additional commitments to reduce GHG emissions, the world is on a trajectory to an increase in global mean temperature of 3.7C to 4.8C compared to pre-industrial levels. When accounting for full climate uncertainty, this range extends from 2.5C to 7.8C by the end of the century. The consequences of such a temperature rise would be catastrophic. A recent report prepared by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for the World Bank4 describes a dramatic 3 The sustainability of the large-scale deployment of some net negative emissions technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestratation (BECCS), raises issues still under debate, in part due to the competition in land uses for energy and food purposes. 4 Schellnhuber, HJ, et al. Turn down the heat: climate extremes, regional impacts, and the case for resilience - full report. Washington DC; World Bank. June 2013. xii picture of a 4C warmer world, where climate and weather extremes would cause devastation and intense human suffering. It would have severe repercussions on human and physical systems and potentially unleash positive feedback mechanisms that further amplify the human drivers. The IPCC AR5 and a large number of other international and national assessments validate this finding. It is therefore vital that the world become much more serious about the implications of staying within the 2C limit. Governments, businesses, and civil society must understand and operationalize the profound transformations required to reach this target. We do not subscribe to the view held by some that the 2C limit is impossible to achieve and that it should be weakened or dropped altogether. The science is clear that global warming beyond 2C carries the risk of grave and irreversible harm to human wellbeing and development prospects in all countries. The political risks of jettisoning the 2C limit are also significant. If the world fails to mobilize in support of the 2C limit or if countries try to weaken it there will be no realistic prospect for the international community to agree to another quantitative target. Countries would find themselves on a slippery downward slope with no quantitative foothold to organize an international and coordinated response to climate change. The 2C limit is an invaluable tool for international mobilization that must be preserved. The latest scientific research indicates that keeping below the 2C limit is challenging but feasible. Global studiesincluding the scenarios reviewed by the IPCCC AR5 WG3, the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) and Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) reports, and the Global Energy Assessment (GEA) led by the Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)show that reducing global GHG emissions to a level consistent with the 2C limit is still within reach. Clearly, though, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Countries therefore need to act quickly and in a determined and coordinated manner to keep the 2C limit within reach. Very few countries have looked seriously at the operational implications of staying within the 2C limit. All large emitting countries now have quantified targets to reduce their GHG emissions by the year 2020. But these targetswhich sometimes are yet to be backed by detailed policy actions and implementation plansare collectively insufficient to put countries on a trajectory consistent with the long-term global objective of deep decarbonization. In fact most 2020 emissions reductions targets were framed as a deviation from Business-As-Usual (BAU) trends, reductions in the carbon intensity of GDP, or relatively modest decrease in absolute GHG emissions compared to a base year. By and large national targets are not derived from an assessment of what will be needed to stay within the 2C limit. Only an internationally coordinated, goal-oriented approach to operationalizing the 2C limit will allow humanity to avoid dangerous climate change. As this interim DDPP report and many other analyses make clear, staying within 2C will require deep transformations of energy and production systems, industry, agriculture, land use, and other dimensions of human development. It will require profound changes in the prevailing socio-economic development frameworks. Many of the technologies that will need to underpin these transformations are available, but many others are not http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/06/17862361/turn-down-heat-climate-extremes-regional- impacts-case-resilience-full-report xiii ready for large scale deployment.. Making critical low-carbon technologies commercially available and affordable, enabling countries to pursue long-term transformations, will require long-term international cooperation and trust. One important purpose of the DDPP is to lay out an analytical approach to operationalizing the 2C limit that can underpin a goal-oriented international response to mitigating climate change, taking into account country-specific socio-economic conditions and development aspirations. The DDPP aims to help countries think through how to pursue their national development priorities while achieving the deep decarbonization of energy systems by mid-century consistent with the 2C limit. Following the launch of the DDPP in October 2013, the DDPP Country Research Teams have collaborated to identify key principles and requirements for successful DDPs. A broad consensus has emerged on the role of DDPs and criteria for success. Staying within the 2C limit requires that countries develop long-term pathways to deep decarbonization to explore options and develop a long-term strategy. The nature and magnitude of the decarbonization challenge are such that there is no quick and easy fix. Deep decarbonization will not happen overnight, and there is no silver bullet. Deep decarbonization is not about modest and incremental change or small deviations from BAU. In particular, it requires major changes to countries energy and production systems that need to be pursued over the long-term. Decisions made today with regards to, say, power generation and transport infrastructure, will have a long-term impact on future GHG emissions, which must be mapped out carefully and understood quantitatively. The DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams backcast from the global goal of limiting the rise in temperature below 2C to explore the transformations for deep decarbonization required to reach the goal. We use the term backcasting, to describe a process where the future GHG emission target is set, and then the changes needed to achieve that target are determined. Backcasting is not to be confused with rigid, central planning. A process of deep decarbonization must be adaptive, as strategies and pathways will have to be continually revised and updated based on new results from climate science, technological innovation, and lessons learnt from implementation. The DDPP follows a two-stage approach to problem solving. The first, which is the focus of this report, is to identify technically feasible DDPs for achieving the objective of limiting the rise in global temperatures below 2C. At this stage, we have not looked in detail at the issue of costs and benefits, not considered the question of who should pay for them. In a secondlaterstage we will refine the analysis of the technical potential, exploring the options for even deeper decarbonization pathways, and better taking into account infrastructure stocks. We will also take a broader perspective, beyond technical feasibility, by quantifying costs and benefits, estimating national and international finance requirements, mapping out domestic and global policy frameworks, and considering in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met. These issues will be described in the 2015 DDPP report. But technically feasible DDPs are a vital first step towards achieving the 2C limit, by illuminating the scale and nature of technological and structural changes required and their related investment needs. xiv The technical DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams rest on a number of national and global policy assumptions that will be investigated in more detail in the 2015 DDPP report. These policy assumptions include:  All countries take strong, early, and coordinated actions to achieve deep decarbonization.  All countries adopt adequate nationally appropriate policies, regulations, and incentives.  Financial flows are re-directed from high-carbon to low-carbon portfolios and projects.  Financial support is provided to countries that appropriately require financial assistance to implement mitigation policies and finance low-carbon investments. The DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams presented in this report are intended to provide a complementary analysis to existing global-level studies of deep emissions reductions. To make a strong and convincing case for action at the national level, DDPs must be country-specific and developed and owned by local experts. They need to fit within countries development strategies and align with their other socio-economic and environmental goals. They need to demonstrate that the short- and long-term challenges countries face, such as economic development, poverty eradication, job creation, inequality reduction, energy and food security, and biodiversity protection, can be addressed in parallel to deep decarbonization. DDPs must take into account country-specific infrastructure stocks and natural resource endowments. They must also take into account the systemic implications and the inherent gradual pace of changing technology, infrastructure, and capital stocks within countries. None of this can be accomplished through aggregate global models and studies, which are not granular enough to present a detailed technical roadmap for policy implementation at the country level DDPs are indispensable for promoting a national dialogue on decarbonization and launching a process of intense and complex problem solving. Transparent DDPs can enable a public discussion in every country on how best to achieve emission reduction objectives, understand possible trade-offs, and identify synergies or win-wins. Such technical analysis and national dialogue on deep decarbonization will involve business, civil society, and various expert communities (e.g. engineers, geologists, climatologists, economists, social scientists) to debate the best options for decarbonization, identify bottlenecks, and propose new approaches. DDPs can become a framework for organizing a dynamic process of discussion and problem solving in every country. DDPs equally are indispensable for building trust across countries, shaping their expectations, and identifying where international cooperation and assistance is required. DDPs show how each country aims to achieve deep decarbonization and demonstrate the seriousness of national commitments to reduce GHG emissions. Transparent DDPs can enhance trust among countries, which is critical for a concerted international response to climate change. They will also help highlight areas that require international assistance and increased international cooperation, particularly on RDD&D of low-carbon technologies. xv In aggregate, the initial DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams outlined in this report achieve deep absolute emissions reductions by 2050. Total CO2-energy emissions from the 15 preliminary DDPs already reach a level of 12.3 Gt by 2050, down from 22.3 Gt in 2010. This represents a 45% decrease of total CO2-energy emissions over the period, and a 56% and 88% reduction in emissions per capita and the carbon intensity of GDP, respectively. The interim DDPs do not yet achieve the full decarbonization needed to make staying below the 2C limit likely, defined as a higher than two-thirds probability of success. The Country Research Teams have identified additional opportunities for deep decarbonization that will be incorporated in the next version of the DDPs (see Chapter VI) to be published in 2015. Nonetheless, the aggregate decarbonization pathway is already very substantial and well on its way to becoming consistent with the 2C target. The preliminary DDPs already provide key insights and identify unique elements of deep decarbonization in each country. These include the key components of nationally appropriate strategies and the most promising country-specific technology options for deep decarbonization. The initial DDPs also identify the principal challenges that still need to be addressed by the DDPP. Finally, the DDPs provide initial indications of the enabling conditions for the successful implementation of deep decarbonization. Understanding and meeting these conditions will require further refinement through careful analysis, public consultation, and learning by doing. The 15 DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams share three common pillars of deep decarbonization of national energy systems: 1) Energy efficiency and conservation: Greatly improved energy efficiency in all energy end-use sectors including passenger and goods transportation, through improved vehicle technologies, smart urban design, and optimized value chains; residential and commercial buildings, through improved end-use equipment, architectural design, building practices, and construction materials; and industry, through improved equipment, production processes, material efficiency, and re-use of waste heat. 2) Low-carbon electricity: Decarbonization of electricity generation through the replacement of existing fossil-fuel-based generation with renewable energy (e.g. hydro, wind, solar, and geothermal), nuclear power, and/or fossil fuels (coal, gas) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). 3) Fuel Switching: Switching end-use energy supplies from highly carbon-intensive fossil fuels in transportation, buildings, and industry to lower carbon fuels, including low-carbon electricity, other low-carbon energy carriers synthesized from electricity generation or sustainable biomass, or lower-carbon fossil fuels. Within the three pillars that are common to all countries, individual DDPs show a wide variety of different approaches based on national circumstances. Differentiating national circumstances xvi include socio-economic conditions, the availability of renewable energy resources, and national preferences regarding the development of renewable energy, nuclear power, CCS, and other technologies. For example, the DDP developed by the Indian team decarbonizes power generation using primarily renewable energy and nuclear power, but not CCS, because the scale of the potential for geological carbon sequestration in India is still uncertain. At the other end of the spectrum, the DDPs developed by the Canadian, Chinese, Indonesian, Mexican, Russian, and UK teams project a significant share of coal and gas-fired power generation with CCS by 2050. The preliminary DDPs also reveal the sectors in which deep emissions reductions are most challenging, particularly freight and industry. Relative to the state of knowledge about low-carbon strategies in other areas such as power generation, buildings, and passenger transport, decarbonization strategies for freight and industry are less well developed and understood. These two sectors constitute a key focus area for future analysis by the DDPP and a future challenge for global RDD&D efforts. Some potential solutions have been identified for freight and industry. Decarbonization options for freight include improved propulsion technologies (battery electric, hybrid, compressed or liquefied (natural or synthetized) gas, and hydrogen); modal shifts (e.g. from road transport to trains and ships); and sustainable biofuels and synthesized fuels for air and maritime transport. Decarbonization options for industry include improved efficiency, electrification of boilers, re-use of process waste heat, sustainable biomass (both energy crops and waste material), and CCS. Some of the identified decarbonization options for industry and freight have yet to be included in all DDPs. Some Country Research Teams will include additional decarbonization options in their revised DDPs. They will also ensure consistency of national projections for industrial production, in particular for energy and mining products, with the forecasted global demand and the domestic needs for infrastructure development by 2050. Given the technological challenges associated with deep emission reductions in the freight and industry sectors, complementary measures to reduce or limit the growth of demand for their products and services will be explored, taking into account countries socio- economic goals and strategies. The analysis by the 15 Country Research Teams also confirms that the technical feasibility of deep decarbonization rests on the large-scale deployment of several low-carbon technologies, some of which are not yet fully commercialized or affordable. For this reason, countries and the international community as a whole must undertake a major research, development, demonstration, and diffusion (RDD&D) effort to develop low-carbon technologies and ensure their widespread availability and their affordability. xvii All Country Research Teams have adopted project-wide assumptions regarding the development and deployment of critical low-carbon technologies:  There will be sufficient global RDD&D and international cooperation to make all the relevant pre- commercial low-carbon technologies commercially viable and widely available in a timely and scaled manner.  Critical low-carbon technologies will become competitive and affordable, through the combined effects of carbon pricing, policy incentives, and cost-reduction through learning effects and economies of scale.  Low-carbon technologies will be made available to all countries through mechanisms for technology cooperation, including funding as necessary, and all barriers to technology diffusion will be removed. Some key technologies, which are critical for deep decarbonization in all DDPs, are not yet technically mature or economically affordable. They include:  Advanced energy storage, flexible load management, and integrated portfolio design for balancing power systems with high penetrations of variable renewable energy (e.g. wind and solar)  Very high performance appliances, controls, and materials for buildings  Zero emissions vehicles with adequate range, notably battery electric or fuel cell light-duty vehicles  Sustainable biofuels or synthesized fuels for air and marine transport Some emerging low-carbon technologies are key in a subset of the 15 DDPs. These include:  New types of renewable energy technologies (e.g. advanced geothermal, deep offshore wind, and tidal energy)  Carbon-capture and sequestration (on fossil-fueled power plants and industries)  Advanced nuclear power technology that sustains public confidence and support The Country Teams underscore that successful implementation of national DDPs depends on directed technological changethat is technological change that is propelled through an organized, sustained, and funded effort engaging government, academia, and business with targeted technological outcomes in mind. No Country Research Team was comfortable assuming that their country alone could develop the requisite low-carbon technologies. Likewise, market forces alone will not be sufficient to promote the required RDD&D at the right scale, timing, and coordination across economies and sectorseven when these market forces are guided by potential large profits from the generation of new intellectual property. Technological success will therefore require a globally coordinated effort in technology development, built on technology roadmaps for each of the key, pre- commercial low-carbon technologies. Directed technological change should not be conceived as picking winners, but as making sure the market has enough winners to pick from to achieve cost-effective low-carbon outcomes. While directed-technological change is essential to meeting the challenge of deep decarbonization, there are many alternative technologies under development now and that may emerge in the future. Technology roadmaps and policy coordination should always leave room for new developments. Efforts aimed at building public support and acceptance for key technologies will also play an important role. xviii The preliminary results and the approach of the DDPP itself reveal the critical importance of preparing country-level DDPs to 2050. These pathways, and the discussion of their results and input assumptions, are essential tools for learning and problem solving. This process is crucial to developing a long-term vision for deep decarbonization and shaping the expectations of countries, businesses, and investors about future development opportunities. The DDPP and similar processes afford a unique opportunity for teams to work together across countries to map out how the global 2C limit can be operationalized and achieved at the country level. It highlights the need to introduce long-term backcasting into the scope of the climate negotiations preparing COP21. The current focus of the international negotiations on mitigation is on emission reduction targets to 2025 or 2030. Yet if countries do not work with a longer time horizon and backcast from this long-term target, they are likely to adopt strategies that fall far short of what is needed to stay below the 2C limit. By its structure, the current incremental approach will fail to consider the deep systemic changes and the key technologies that are still pre-commercial but necessary to reach the target. What the DDPP process illustrates is that at least two new elements will need to be part of the global deal in 2015 at COP21 in Paris. These do not cover the full scope of the agreement, in particular the need to provide adequate support (financial, technological, and capacity building) to countries that appropriately require it to undertake the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions. But they are nonetheless an essential component of a successful global deal to operationalize the 2C target, and deep decarbonization would lower the needs and costs of unavoidable adaptation:  Country DDPs: A shared global commitment that each country will develop and make publicly available a (non-binding) DDP to 2050 that is consistent with the 2C limit and their national circumstances. Official country DDPs (as distinct from illustrative DDPs, developed by researchers) would be predicated on a shared commitment to the global target and to all aspects of global cooperation needed to achieve it, including technology cooperation, financial support, and policy coordination.  Global, large-scale RDD&D of low-carbon technologies: A massive and sustained global public-private effort to develop, demonstrate, and diffuse various low-carbon technologies that are not yet technically mature or competitive and are key to the success of deep decarbonization. It is our hope that this interim 2014 report and upcoming DDPP reports will make a useful contribution to operationalizing the 2C target. In particular we hope that the DDPP can help spur the design and international comparison of national DDPs and promote the necessary global cooperation to achieve them. To further this discussion we invite comments and suggestions for improvement on this interim 2014 report before August 15, 2014. xix xx Staying within the 2C limit: the solemn responsibility of the global community ........................ 1 Business as usual means catastrophic climate change is likely .................................................. 2 Even a 2C increase in global temperatures entails major risks .................................................. 3 Why the world needs to stick to the 2C limit .............................................................................. 3 How to pursue the 2C limit seriously .......................................................................................... 4 1.1. 1.2. 1.3. 1.4. 1.5. Our moment of truth has arrived. Twenty-two years ago at the Rio Earth Summit, the worlds governments recognized that humanity was changing the climate system profoundly, posing risks for human wellbeing and sustainable development prospects. They adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) two years later, and resolved to protect the planet and promote sustainable development by stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Yet, more than two decades later, GHG emissions are still far from stabilizing. In 1994, at the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) of the UNFCCC, CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and direct CO2 emissions from industrial processes were 23 billion tons (gigatons or Gt), and the CO2 concentration stood at 358.8 parts per million (ppm). By 2013, at COP19, global CO2 emissions had soared to 36 billion tons, and CO2 concentrations stood at 396.5 ppm.5 Every country has signed on to fight against human-induced climate change, but the world remains dangerously off course from the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. There is, as of yet, no prospect of stabilizing GHG concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous human-induced climate change. The Parties to the UNFCCC have now had 19 annual meetings since 1994. These COPs have borne the worlds hopes and disappointments in our collective inability to date to head off a growing catastrophe. At the 16th COP held in Cancun in 2010, the worlds governments committed to a new and clear target: to keep the global rise in mean surface temperature below 2C compared with the pre-industrial average. The COP added a proviso that the 2C limit may be revised downward to 1.5C in light of available science. The 2C limit is the worlds most explicit, and many climate scientists would say last- ditch, effort to operationalize the goal of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. 5 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) data. http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/ 1 A clear goal is set, but the means to achieve it have not yet been established. Since 2010, the Parties have struggled to create a framework of climate mitigation that is up to the task. For several years now, all eyes have been on the road to Paris, COP21 in December 2015, the date that the worlds governments assigned themselves to reach an agreement to implement the 2C limit. December 2015 is our last chance, in the sense that a success at Paris would enable the world to just barely maintain the chance to keep the temperature rise within the 2C limit. A failure in Paris would almost certainly put the 2C limit out of reach. Despite the 2C commitment reiterated at every COP since Cancun, global GHG emissions have continued to rise sharply. The climate science is clear and unequivocal: without a dramatic reversal of the GHG emissions trajectoryone that leads to a significant decline in GHG emissions by mid-century and to net zero emissions during the second half of the centurythe world will not only overshoot the 2C limit, but will do so dramatically. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) shows that without major efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those already committed, the world is on a path to an average temperature increase of 3.7C to 4.8C compared to pre-industrial levels. When accounting for full climate uncertainty, this range extends from 2.5C to 7.8C. The business-as-usual (BAU) course is so deeply entrenched that one study after another blithely assumes that the world will overshoot the 2C limit. One can review any authoritative report on energy trendsby the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Energy Information Association (EIA), or industry groups such as BP or Shelland the result is the same: all reports present a baseline or BAU trajectory of roughly 4C. This outcome is somehow received as normal, despite the global commitment stating otherwise. Clearly, our global politics and our energy practices are out of line, though they are implicitly accepted as normal. Yet this is anything but normal. Humanity faces catastrophic risks on our current path. The risks of unabated climate change are enormous. They threaten every prospect of achieving sustainable development and humanitys fervent hopes to end poverty and achieve a decent life for all on this planet. The current trajectory is not just risky; it is potentially catastrophic. Runaway climate change would threaten the life-support systems of the planet: food production, human health and productivity, and safety from extreme storms and other climate disruptions. Rising sea levels would overtake many of the worlds largest urban agglomerations and low-lying countries, such as Bangladesh and small island states. Many threatened regions in todays poor world, particularly the tropics, drylands, forests, and alpine regions, may become uninhabitable, leading to mass migration and suffering. Some in the developed world might be skeptical that such dangers will reach them. Yet, they are mistaken. Crises in any part of the world can quickly become global, as when droughts, floods, or violence resulting from food shortages result in conflict, mass migration movements, soaring food prices, and more. Disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy in the United States, intense heat waves in Europe, recent mega-floods in Serbia, and massive forest fires and droughts in parts of Australia, all clearly demonstrate that even the highly developed countries face dire and often uncontrollable threats when nature is disrupted. 2 The prospects for successfully adapting to such changes are slim; the environmental shocks would likely overcome human and technological systems. The argument of economic development first, climate change later therefore makes no sense. Uncontrolled climate change would gravely threaten economic development. Avoiding dangerous climate change and achieving sustainable development are, in summary, inextricably linked. Managing the transition to deep decarbonization is critical to ensure that development needs are met within the constraints of profound GHG emissions reductions. But avoiding dangerous climate change is equally essential to safeguard development opportunities in both rich and poor countries. Recent scientific evidence suggests that even a temperature increase of only 2C may generate very severe, pervasive and irreversible risks. Some leading climate scientists are in fact advising to limit global warming to 1C instead. They cite the grave long-term consequences that a 2C increase could have on the earth, society, and future generations. Professor Hansen, formerly the top climate scientist at NASA, points out that Earth's paleoclimate history projects that a 2C global warming is likely to result in eventual sea-level rise of six meters (20 feet).6 He and others also emphasize that warming of 2C could induce slow amplifying feedbacks. For example, the Amazon rainforest could eventually die as a result of repeated drought, releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Similarly, methane and CO2 buried in the permafrost in the tundra could be released into the air as the tundra melts. By pushing the climate beyond the experience of the human era of the past 100,000 years, the world risks inducing conditions that are inhospitable for the human species and millions of others, especially when humanity now comprises more than 7 billion inhabitants on a crowded planet. A 2C increase in global temperatures is therefore far from risk-free. But keeping below 2C of global warming is indispensable to maintain climate change within the boundaries of manageable risks and to our ability to adapt to climate change. Some observers argue that the 2C limit has become too difficult to achieve and should be weakened. Others go even further, suggesting that the world should abandon a global emissions target altogether and instead follow a pure bottom-up approach to global emissions reduction. Yet jettisoning or weakening the 2C limit would be profoundly dangerous for several important and clear reasons. First, as just described, the burgeoning scientific evidence suggests that 2C is the upper limit of safety. Not only could a increase in temperatures by 2C bring untold suffering in many parts of the world from severe climate disruptions such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and intense tropical cyclones, but a rise in temperature of 2C or more threatens many positive feedback loops that could push the global climate system into runaway and irreversible disruptions. 6 Such findings are not reported in the IPCC, which limits forecasts to 2100. 3 Second, loosening or dropping the internationally agreed goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 2C without ever having tried seriously to achieve it could spell the death of multilateral attempts to control anthropogenic climate change. The global doubts about the UN and the multilateral system would become profound, especially after more than two decades of failed efforts to implement the UNFCCC. There are already many influential voices that have written off the multilateral processes. Third, there is no logical foothold or stopping point beyond 2C. The world will not find a safe resting point, say at 2.5 or 3C. Loosening the 2C limit would very likely lead to a world without a quantified climate goal. Fourth, without a shared climate goal, the package of accompanying cooperative global actions (on financing, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and more) required will also not be put in place. Global goals imply the means for implementing them. Dropping these goals will gravely undermine the will to cooperate on the implementation of climate mitigation actions. Yet, there is little prospect of deep decarbonization for almost any nation unless there is a global cooperative framework, in particular on technology demonstration and scale up. There is simply no capacity for countries to achieve the necessary deep transformations required to decarbonize their economy alone. Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, many studies indicate that the 2C limit remains achievable at relatively modest costs globally if the right cooperative framework is put in place. The global scenarios reviewed by the IPCC AR5 for example illustrate that there are technically feasible pathways that keep the global increase in temperature below 2C, utilizing technologies that are already or close to being commercially available. Similar scenarios by the IEA underscore the same point. Available studies show that the 2C limit technologically feasible and that it is also likely to be economically affordable. They suggest that the global costs of reducing GHG emissions to keep the temperature increase below 2C are modest compared to the size of the world economy. The IPCC AR5 for example calculates a 0.06 (0.04 to 0.14) percentage point reduction in the annualized consumption growth rates over the period 20102100 for the scenarios achieving a stabilization of GHG concentrations between 430 and 480 ppm, which give a likely chance  defined as higher than two- thirds  of keeping the global temperature increase below 2C. The truth is that governments have not yet tried hard enoughor, to be frank, simply tried in an organized and thoughtful wayto understand and do what is necessary to keep global warming below the 2C limit. There is, in short, no reason to jettison the 2C limit before we have really tried. This report describes some of the important steps countries should follow to take the 2C limit seriously:  Recognize the global carbon budget and global GHG emissions reduction trajectories to 2050 consistent with the 2C limit.  Develop country-level Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDPs) to 2050 consistent with the 2C limit, predicated on a shared commitment to the global goal and to all aspects of global cooperation needed to achieve it, including technology cooperation, financial support, and policy coordination. 4  Organize a massive global public-private effort to develop, demonstrate, and diffuse various low-carbon technologies that are not yet technically mature or competitive and are key to the success of deep decarbonization. 5 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Total CO2 budget for the period 2011-2100 ................................................................................. 6 Total CO2 budget for the period 2011-2050 ................................................................................ 7 CO2-energy budget from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes ............................ 7 Global CO2-energy emissions reduction trajectories to 2050 ...................................................... 8 Fossil fuel proven reserves and resources ................................................................................... 9 There is a meaningful correlation between total cumulative emissions of GHGs (measured in tons of CO2 equivalent), their long-term concentrations and radiative forcing (measured in ppm of CO2 equivalent and watts per square meter, respectively), and the resulting global average temperature response (measured in increase of global average temperatures). The overall relation between cumulative GHG emissions and global temperature increase has been determined to be approximately linear. However, since there is uncertainty surrounding the relationship of cumulative GHG emissions and global temperature, we must speak in terms of probability. A given cumulative path of GHG emissions will offer a given probability of staying below an increase of 2C of mean surface temperature relative to preindustrial levels. In general, we are interested in global pathways that are likely to stay below 2C. Likely is usually defined as a probability of two-thirds or higher. The IPCC AR5 review of climate model scenarios has found that in order to have a likely chance of staying within the 2C limit, the peak concentration of atmospheric GHGs would need to be in the range between 430 and 480 ppm of CO2 equivalent by 2100.7 That in turn implies a limit on total cumulative GHG emissions over time. For the purpose of the DDPP, we are particularly interested in the level of cumulative CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes permissible by mid- centurywhich, for simplicity, we call CO2-energysince our Country Research Teams are developing pathways to the deep decarbonization of their energy systems to 2050. Below, we describe the steps and assumptions to calculate this CO2-energy budget. Defining a budget for CO2 only (the largest single source of total GHG emissions at 76%) for the 2011 2100 period requires making assumptions regarding several factors, including: the non-CO2 GHGs like methane, N2O, and F-gases, as well as contributions from climate-changing factors such as aerosols and land-use albedo; the timing of CO2 emission reductions (and therefore the time the carbon cycle has to absorb the CO2 emitted); and the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 and the other forcings. Taking into account these factors, the IPCC AR5 Working Group 3 (WG3) found that the level of cumulative CO2 emissions for the period 20112100 should be within the range of 630 to 1180 Gt 7 See IPCC AR5 Working Group III - Mitigation of Climate Change, Chapter 6: Assessing Transformation Pathways, Table 6.3. December 2013. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/ 6 (billion tons) of CO2, in order to achieve CO2 concentrations consistent with a likely chance of keeping within the 2C limit8. To define a CO2 budget for the 2011-2050 period, we need to take the century-long CO2 emissions and divide them into two time periods: 2011-2050 and 2051-2100. The bulk of emissions will occur in the first period, since net emissions should decline to zero during the second period. Some scenarios reviewed by the IPCC AR5 WG3 are based on the idea of net negative emissions during the second half of the century. Net negative emissions could be achieved, for example, if the use of biomass for energy production is deployed with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Biomass would be burned in power plants, and the power plants would in turn capture and sequester the CO2. This is called bioenergy plus carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). There are other potential net negative emissions technologies, including direct air capture of CO2. To the extent that negative emissions are available on a large scale in the second half of the century, the CO2 budget for the first half of the century would be correspondingly higher. But the feasibility and sustainability of large-scale net negative emissions is still under debate. BECCS in particular raises serious issues, since it combines the dual challenge of large-scale biomass production and large-scale storage of CO2. At the global level, the large-scale use of biomass for energy production could cause deforestation and compete with land-use for food production, although in some countries the sustainable large-scale use of biomass for energy purposes could be feasible. The scale of the geological potential for CO2 sequestration is also under debate, and CCS would have to be deployed first on fossil-fueled power plants and industries. We have therefore made an assumption in the DDPP that large-scale net negative emissions are still too uncertain to build into our country-level Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDPs), even though we strongly support research programs that could make net negative emissions a future reality. Based on the best estimates regarding non-CO2 forcings and excluding the availability of large-scale net negative emissions, the IPCC AR5 WG3 defines a CO2 budget for the 20112050 period of 825 Gt9 and of 950 Gt for the period 20112100.10 This implies 125 Gt of CO2 cumulative net emissions for the period 2051-2100. The CO2 budget of 950 Gt during 2011-2100 combines CO2 emissions from land use, the burning of fossil fuels, and industrial processes. Defining a budget for CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes only (the focus of our country-level DDPs) requires that we make assumptions 8 See IPCC AR5 Working Group III - Mitigation of Climate Change, Chapter 6: Assessing Transformation Pathways, Table 6.3. December 2013. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/ 9 See IPCC AR5 Working Group III - Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II, Table A.II.19 December 2013. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/ 10 See IPCC AR5 Working Group III - Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II, Table A.II.18 December 2013. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/ 7 regarding the potential for CO2 emission reductions in the land-use sector and the potential for net biological sequestration of CO2 in particular through reforestation, peat production, wetland restoration, and improved agricultural practices. As a preliminary standard, we adopted the same assumption as the IPCC AR5 WG3 of net zero emissions from land-use over this century. This means that the 950 Gt total CO2 budget for the 20112100 period can be considered as a budget for CO2-energy only. The budget for CO2-energy only for the 20112050 period is somewhat lower than 825 Gt, since land-use is assumed to reach net zero emissions only over the century, not by mid-century. But we emphasize that there is great uncertainty regarding the precise potential and timing for CO2 emissions reduction and net biological sequestration of CO2 in land use, and that more research is urgently needed. It might prove to be impossible to achieve net zero emissions in the land use sector, further reducing the size of the CO2-energy budget. Alternatively it may prove to be possible to achieve net negative emissions in the land use sector, in which case the permissible budget for CO2-energy would rise accordingly. We hope to be able to define a more precise CO2-energy budget for the 2011 2050 period in the next phases of the DDPP. Given all these uncertainties, there are many possible global CO2-energy emissions reduction trajectories that are consistent with a 2C path. For the purpose of the DDPP, the projected level of annual CO2-energy emissions in 2050 is of particular interest. The range of 2050 emissions in scenarios surveyed by the IPCC AR5 WG3 that give a likely chance of staying within the 2C limit is large. It has a median value of approximately 11-12 Gt of CO2-energy. In particular, the RCP 2.6 scenario, developed by PBL Netherlands Environmental Agencywhich gives a probability higher than 66% of staying within the 2C limit reaches 11.7 Gt of CO2-energy in 2050. For comparison, the 2050 level of CO2- energy emissions projected in the International Energy Agencys (IEA) 2-degree scenario (2DS11)which gives a 50% chance of staying below 2C of global warmingis 15 GtCO2-energy. 11 See the following for a description of the portfolio of related IEA scenarios: http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/ 8 Proven reserves are defined as those fossil fuel amounts that are economically viable under current economic and technological conditions. Resources are defined as amounts in addition to proven reserves that are technologically accessible and potentially economically viable. We also distinguish between conventional and unconventional oil and gas. Conventional oil and gas are deposits that can be extracted by conventional means. Unconventional oil deposits include shale oil, heavy oil, bitumen oil sands, and extra-heavy oil. Unconventional gas deposits include shale gas, tight gas, and coal-bed methane. By the end of 2012, the proven reserves amounted to 1.3 trillion barrels of conventional oil, 220 trillion cubic meters of conventional natural gas, and 1010 Gt of coal (including 730 Gt of hard coal and 280 Gt of lignite)12. Proven reserves of unconventional oil were 0.4 trillion barrels, and reserves of unconventional gas are estimated to be 4-10 times higher than those of conventional gas. Taking all fossil fuels together, proven reserves represent approximately 3667-7119 GtCO2 of potential CO2- energy emissions. Aggregate fossil fuel resources are enormous, representing approximately 31,352 50,092 GtCO2 of potential CO2-energy emissions. Combining reserves and resources, the CO2-energy content reaches 35,019-57,211 GtCO2.13 12 See BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2013 9 Table 2.1.

The amount of CO2 contained in proven reserves is roughly 3-7 times larger than the CO2-energy budget. Total reserves and resources exceed the CO2-energy budget by some 35-60 times. The conclusion is stark: there are vastly more reserves and resources than the world can use safely. This conclusion is true even allowing for a significant share of biological and geological sequestration of CO2. Even under optimistic assumptions, the deployment of CCS will not enable the use of all fossil fuel resources or even reserves. As a reference, the IEA ETP 2DS scenario assumes CCS of around 125 Gt of CO2 until 2050. All elements of CCS are proven at the pilot scale. But the feasibility of large-scale CCS deployment remains under debate, since the scale of geological storage sites where carbon can be sequestered remains uncertain. Twelve CCS projects at stationary point sources operate around the world (most of them on natural gas processing plants, some of them on fertilizer production plants). Nine more CCS projects are under construction. Since CCS is a critical abatement technology in most global mitigation scenarios, including in many of the DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams, countries and businesses need to urgently increase the levels of RDD&D in CCS to test if it can be technically and economically deployed at a large scale. In the absence of CCS, many countriesin particular those relying heavily of fossil fueled power generationwould find it much more difficult to achieve deep decarbonization. But it is clear from the numbers reviewed above that a very large share of the fossil fuel reserves plus resources will have to stay in the ground or be strandedthat is, left unused in the long-term. The already-proven reserves are many times beyond the safe level of cumulative fossil fuel use, yet the energy sector invests hundreds of billions of dollars each year to discover and develop new resources and reserves. This raises the obvious question whether such investments are well directed, or are simply wasteful, developing reserves that can never be safely used. One would instead expect the fossil fuel industries to be investing far more heavily in the RDD&D of CCS in order to increase the proportion of existing reserves and resources that will eventually be usable. 13 IPCC AR5 WG3 Table 7.2 10 Of the three fossil fuels, coal deposits will likely be stranded in the highest proportion. This is for four reasons. First, its reserve and resource levels are much higher than those of oil and gas and vastly greater than any plausible CO2-energy budget. Second, the CO2 per unit of energy of coal is much greater than that of oil and gas (22% and 68% higher, respectively).14 Third, coal use often has very serious adverse side effects, such as air pollution that causes severe disease burdens. Fourth, most coal is used in relatively large stationary sources, e.g. power plants, where lower-carbon and zero- carbon substitutes are relatively easy to identify. Indeed, given the substitutes for coal, it may soon be feasible and necessary for many or most countries to stop building new coal-fired power plants except for those that deploy CCS. In addition to the stranding of coal deposits, it is clear that the available oil and gas reserves plus resources is also large relative to the CO2-energy budget. Yet which of those oil and gas reserves and resources will be stranded and which will be developed? The efficient answer is to deploy the lowest- cost oil and gas (taking into account their respective CO2 content per unit of energy in the cost calculations), leaving the higher-cost oil and gas in the ground. The issue is not conventional versus non-conventional resources per se; it is the relative cost of the development and extraction of the alternatives. We note that stranding assets will have high distributional consequences. A country with stranded fossil fuel reserves may lose considerable potential income. Therefore, the decisions on how to strand assets (e.g. through consumption or production permits, carbon taxation, etc.) will have large distributional implications for sharing the global effort of emissions reduction that will need to be considered in any successful international framework. 14 See IEA WEO 2012 11 3.1 3.2 The drivers of CO2 emissions ...................................................................................................... 12 The 3 pillars of the deep decarbonization .................................................................................. 13 Deep decarbonization requires a very significant transformation of energy systems. The ultimate objective of this transformation is to phase out fossil fuel combustion with uncontrolled CO2 emissions. Only fossil fuels in conjunction with CCS would remain. Since the CO2 contained in proven reserves and resources of fossil fuels vastly exceeds the 2C global CO2-energy budget, the transformation toward a low-carbon energy system cannot be driven by the scarcity of fossil fuels. The simplest way to describe the deep decarbonization of energy systems is by the principal drivers of energy-related CO2 emissionsfor convenience, since the focus of this chapter is on energy systems, we simply refer to them as CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions can be expressed as the product of four inputs: population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP, and CO2 emissions per unit of energy: CO2 emissions = Population x (GDP/Population) x (Energy/GDP) x (CO2/Energy) If we take as given the population trajectory and assume a rising trajectory of GDP per capita in line with a successful economic development program, then CO2 emissions are driven mainly by two factors: Energy/GDP and CO2/Energy. The first term is the energy intensity, meaning the amount of energy per unit of final output. The second term is the carbon intensity of energy. The energy intensity of GDP (Energy/GDP) can be reduced through energy efficiency and conservation measures in energy end-use sectors (passenger and goods transportation, residential and commercial buildings, and industry). We refer to energy efficiency measures as the technical improvements of products and processes; we use the term energy conservation to describe a broader set of measures, including structural and behavioral changes, that lead to lower levels of energy consumed per unit of GDP. Examples of energy efficiency and conservation measures improved vehicle (for passenger and goods technologies, smart urban design, and optimized value chains transportation); improved end-use equipment, architectural design, building practices, and construction materials (in residential and commercial buildings); improved equipment, production processes, material efficiency, and re-use of waste heat (in industry). The carbon intensity of energy (CO2/Energy) can be reduced in two ways. First, the decarbonization of electricity generation (low-carbon electricity) through the replacement of uncontrolled fossil fuel based generation with renewable energy (e.g. hydro, wind, solar, and geothermal), nuclear power, and/or fossil fuels (coal, gas) with CCS. Second, switching end-use energy supplies (fuel switching) from highly carbon-intensive fossil fuels in transportation, buildings, and industry to lower carbon fuels, including include: 12 low-carbon electricity, other low-carbon energy carriers synthesized from electricity generation or sustainable biomass, or lower-carbon fossil fuels. In sum, the deep decarbonization of energy systems rests on three pillars:  Energy efficiency and conservation  Low-carbon electricity  Fuel-switching In order to deliver the required deep reductions in CO2 emissions, countries must implement all three pillars of decarbonization in a coordinated manner. No single approach is sufficient given the magnitude of the deep decarbonization challenge. In the global scenarios reviewed by the IPCC AR5 WG3 that give a likely chance of staying within the 2C limit, the carbon intensity of GDP (CO2/GDP) decreases by approximately 90% compared to its 2010 level. This is the result of a combined 60% reduction in the energy intensity of GDP (Energy/GDP) and 70% reduction in the carbon intensity of energy (CO2/Energy) compared to their 2010 levels. The analysis of the scenarios also shows the temporal dynamics of the decarbonization of energy systems. At first, the reductions in the energy intensity tend to be larger than the reductions in the carbon intensity. Energy intensity is projected to fall by around 40% by 2030 relative to 2010, compared with a fall in carbon intensity of approximately 20% relative to 2010. But by mid-century, the decrease in the carbon intensity of energy plays a bigger role than the decrease in the energy intensity of GDP in the overall decrease of carbon intensity of GDP. These dynamics are driven, in part, by the effects of electrification. In the short-run, electrification only has a small effect on the CO2 intensity of energy, since electricity generation is still rather carbon- intensive. Though as the electricity supply is decarbonized over the longer term, electrification plays a big role in the decrease of the CO2 intensity of energy. 13 The need for accelerated development of low-carbon technologies ........................................ 14 4.1 4.2 Key technology areas for RDD&D ............................................................................................... 15 4.2.1 Carbon capture and sequestration ............................................................................................. 15 Energy storage and grid management ....................................................................................... 16 4.2.2 4.2.3 Advanced nuclear power ............................................................................................................ 17 Vehicles and advanced biofuels ................................................................................................. 18 4.2.4 4.2.5 Industrial processes .................................................................................................................... 18 4.2.6 Negative emissions technologies ............................................................................................... 18 The role of technology roadmaps and roundtables ................................................................... 19 4.3 lower market barriers. Examples Deep decarbonization of the worlds energy systems requires the deployment of new low-carbon technologies to transform energy production and consumption patterns. This in turn will require accelerated research, development, demonstration, and diffusion (RDD&D) of these emission-reducing technologies to make them reliable, cost-competitive, and widely available in every country. Many of the technologies required for improving energy efficiency, decarbonizing electricity generation, and switching to low-carbon fuels are already technologically mature and commercially viable. They are poised to achieve much higher penetrations in the presence of policies that provide the right incentives and include renewable energy-based electricity generation technologies such as hydropower, wind, and solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power; ethanol production from biomass-derived sugars and starch; power and heating technologies based on hydro- geothermal resources; fuel-efficient, hybrid, and battery electric light-duty vehicles; natural gas, electric hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell-powered buses and fleet vehicles; and a wide range of energy-efficient lighting, heating, cooling, and process technologies in the building and industrial sectors. But existing and commercially available technologies alone will not be sufficient in many national contexts to achieve deep decarbonization. New energy supply and end-use technologies will be needed, requiring various levels of RDD&D in order to achieve widespread uptake. A number of key technology areas requiring focused attention are described below. Some of these technologies are still under development. Some have been demonstrated in pilot projects or in small commercial niches but not yet at large scale. Some are technically viable but at too high a cost for mass adoption. Some lack the complementary infrastructure needed for their deployment, and some face barriers of public concern about safety, reliability, or environmental impacts. 14 Below is a high-level overview of key technology areas for low-carbon RDD&D, based on recent literature, including IEA technology roadmaps, the IPCC AR5 WG3 report, and the Global Energy Assessment (IIASA, 2012). This list of technologies is not comprehensive and represents a snapshot of a continuously evolving energy technology landscape. Many other new technologies are in development today that may emerge in the future. RDD&D efforts for decarbonization should therefore be careful not to preclude any technologies from playing a role in future decarbonization efforts. The focus needs to be on reaching cost-effective emissions reductions. The 15 DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams do not all rely on the same technology mix for decarbonization. In particular, some DDPs do not use CCS, while others do not use nuclear power. But all achieve the objective of deep decarbonization of their national energy systems through technologies that are not yet deployed at large scale. The remainder of this chapter focuses on key technological hurdles that need to be overcome through public and private RDD&D in order to make deep decarbonization possible in all countries. We underscore that the commercial deployment of these technologies will require a broader mix of adequate financing, effective policies (including putting a price on carbon emissions and direct technological support), and public acceptance and support. A full treatment of RDD&D is beyond the scope of this interim report. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) commonly refers to the capture of CO2 at large stationary point sources such as coal and natural gas-fueled power plants, refineries, cement plants, and steel mills that emit exhaust gases with a relatively high concentrations of CO2.15 In some cases, the CO2 is captured after combustion through a chemical process that separates it from the other exhaust gases. In other cases the CO2 is removed from fuels through other chemical processes before combustion. Pre-combustion and post-combustion CCS technologies have a number of variants. A special variant is oxyfuel combustion, in which fuel is combusted in pure oxygen rather than air, resulting in a relatively pure CO2 stream after the removal of water in the exhaust stream. After the CO2 is captured at the point source, it is transported by pipeline to an appropriate geological site for storage underground, typically in saline aquifers more than 800 m below the surface. CCS has not yet been proven as a whole system at large scale, although individual components of CCS (capture, transport, and sequestration) are established technologies. CCS at small scale is already done commercially in applications where CO2 is pumped into partially depleted oil wells for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In this case, the injection of high-pressure CO2 generates commercial value by increasing oil production from existing wells. The economics of CCS for EOR therefore are not primarily driven by the carbon removal objective. To date, 12 CCS projects operate around the globe at stationary point sourcesmostly at natural gas processing plants and some on fertilizer production plants. At last nine more CCS projects are under 15 Air capture, a non-point source form of carbon capture, is discussed below in the negative emissions technologies section. 15 construction. Two large pilot projects for CCS power generation in North America are expected to go online within the next year or two. With construction and operating experience at scale, the relative merits of pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxyfuel CCS technologies for specific applications, emissions requirements, and economic conditions, will be better understood. In the long-term, the largest market for CCS systems will most likely be found in the electric power sector where coal-burning plants constitute the greatest and most concentrated point source of CO2. The main challenges of CCS reside in scale, cost, and verification. The sheer volume of CO2 under consideration is large: for every ton of coal entering a CCS-equipped power plant, about three tons of CO2 must be captured and stored. Open questions include the optimal power plant design to facilitate carbon capture; the design of an effective, reliable, and economical infrastructure to transport CO2; the choice of geological sites for storage at the scale of tens or hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 over coming decades; and the mechanisms for assuring that stored CO2 in fact remains out of the atmosphere. Recent sharp declines in the cost of solar photovoltaic modules and more gradual declines in price of wind turbines have reduced the direct costs of electricity from time-varying renewable energy resources to levels comparable to that from other fuels in many countries. The cost of solar and wind energy, per se, is therefore no longer a substantial impediment. The main challenge remains the intermittency of these energy sources and therefore their inability to provide reliable power on a desired schedule. Power grids must be able to match energy demand and energy supply on a moment-by-moment basis in order to maintain grid functionality and stability. This is traditionally accomplished with large generators, such as coal-fired and nuclear power plants, that provide shock absorption and built-in energy storage by way of their fuel reservoir and massive rotational inertia. These stable base-load generators are complemented by flexible and readily dispatchable units, such as gas turbines, to make for a supply system capable of following demand at will. As the penetration level of intermittent and non-dispatchable renewable resources increases, the electric grid must rely on other low-carbon methods of balancing supply and demand, likely requiring a more refined coordination of diverse resources in space and time. Three principal approaches are available to balance an electric power system with a high penetration of time-varying renewable resources: first, to compensate for the intermittency with other generation; second, to coordinate and control electric demand so as to coincide with power availability (known as demand response and flexible load); and third, energy storage. Examples of the first approach include grid networks that link uncorrelated or negatively correlated supplies of intermittent energy, as well as hybrid systems that combine wind and solar energy with gas-powered electricity generation. However, gas hybrid systems are limited in how much natural gas can be used while meeting the falling target emissions intensity of the grid. Demand response and flexible load offer a large potential resource for adjusting the temporal profile of loads, often taking advantage of thermal energy storage at the end use location. The main challenges of both of these approaches are in the realm of information management, communication, control, and economic incentives. The costs of sensor and communication technologies have declined dramatically 16 so that the potential for decentralized, automatic demand response capability in millions of individual devices is now available. Also, the emergence of electric vehicles with flexible charging capability suggests that an increasing capacity for demand response is becoming available. Storing excess energy for delivery during periods of lower supply is the most obvious approach to matching electric demand and supply since it fits readily into the traditional design philosophy of the grid, although it is not necessarily the least costly. A variety of electric storage technologies are known and have been demonstrated on a broad range of time scales, from seasonal to daily, hourly, and second-by-second storage. Short-term storage may also be used for improving electric power quality and local reliability. Large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage has been cost-effective in many countries for decades. Where it is availablefor example, Norways mountain reservoirs that store Denmarks wind power the intermittency problem can be solved. However, topography, water availability, and environmental concerns greatly limit the feasible locations for pumped hydro storage. Many other storage technologies exist, including batteries, flywheels, compressed air, molten salts, hydrogen (through hydrolysis), and synthetic hydrocarbons (e.g. using captured CO2 plus renewable energy to create liquid hydrocarbons). Substantial development and demonstration is required to determine the best matches between diverse storage technologies and cost-effective applications, and to commercialize these technologies at a large scale. There are presently 40 countries with nuclear energy. Some of these are proposing to phase out their nuclear power fleet, others plan to scale back, and still others are planning to expand their nuclear capacity dramatically. Yet high costs, safety considerations, proliferation concerns, issues of waste management, and public resistance especially following the Fukushima accident currently hinder a decisive scale-up of nuclear energy. Public support for nuclear technology may have important non- technical dimensionsfor example, philosophical differences over appropriate strategies for nuclear waste disposal, as well as symbolic links between nuclear energy and weaponsthat are not readily addressed by engineering improvements. Technical advances, however, also play a critical role. Breakthroughs in safety systems, reliability, fuel security, fuel recycling, and dependably low costs will likely be needed in order for nuclear energy to remain a significant part of the decarbonization pathways of major emitting economies. The term fourth-generation nuclear power generally refers to a range of nuclear fission energy technology advances that involve the modularity of production systems, smaller-scale units, alternative systems for fuel reprocessing, alternative (e.g. thorium) fuels, as well as improved, automatic, and passive safety systems. Design goals include greater simplicity so that reactors are less vulnerable to construction delays and cost overruns; safe operability of reactors as dispatchable, load-following units; and proliferation resistance, i.e. making it much more difficult to divert materials from any point in the fuel cycle for nuclear weapons. Passive reactor safety is another key feature, meaning that the reactor core is assured by physical first principles to be safe from meltdown even in the absence of active cooling (e.g. cooling based on water pumping that itself requires electric power). 17 The decarbonization of the transport fleet, beginning with personal vehicles but also extending to heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, and ocean shipping is crucial to stay within 2C. A range of cutting-edge technologies, such as high-performance batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and advanced biofuels, hold the potential to decarbonize much or all the transport sector. Yet most low-carbon transport technologies are pre-commercial, at least at a large scale. For electric vehicles, lithium ion (Liion) batteries are expected to improve incrementally but new battery technologies will likely be required to achieve higher energy and power densities, lengthen vehicle range, and lower up-front vehicle costs. Biofuels, especially liquid biofuels, offer the prospect of decarbonization with the continued use of existing infrastructure and technologies, including internal combustion engines, oil pipelines, and gas station pumps. Yet biofuels have a clear downside. Many existing biofuels, e.g. maize-based ethanol in the United States, compete with other critical land uses, such as food and feed production and ecosystem needs like land and water utilization. Advanced biofuels aim to overcome the competition between biofuels, food, and ecosystems. Possible technologies for such advanced biofuels include bioengineered organisms (e.g. algae, bacteria) to produce biofuels and the processing of non-foodstuffs from non-arable land into biofuels (e.g. cellulosic biofuels produced from wood products). Efforts to produce fuels directly from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, without using biological organisms (artificial photosynthesis), are still at an early research stage and focus primarily on producing hydrogen. Success here could greatly decrease the land area required to produce a unit of fuel as compared to biomass, but important challenges, such as competing land uses, limited water resources, and sustainable sources of carbon for fuel synthesis will still need to be overcome. Process heat in industry is one of the most challenging sources of energy-CO2 emission to decarbonize. Many industrial processes, such as smelting, cement production, steelmaking, oil refining, and other distillation processes, require vast inputs of heat, typically with very large CO2 emissions. In principle, many of these heat processes could be electrified, or the heat could be produced with zero-emission fuel cells (e.g. hydrogen-based cells). Electrical energy can provide increased efficiency through the appropriate use of directed-heating technologies (e.g. electric arc, magnetic induction, microwave, ultraviolet, radio frequency). Given the diversity of these processes and the varying contexts in which they are used (scale and organization of the industrial processes), it is highly uncertain whether industrial processes can be decarbonized using available technologies. Much greater efforts of RDD&D are therefore required in this under-studied area to ensure deep decarbonization by mid-century. Many low-carbon scenarios, including some in IPCC AR5, project an overshooting of the carbon budget in the first half of the 21st century, which must then be offset through net negative emissions in the second half of the century. The popular placeholder for net negative emissions is the integration of biomass energy (BE) with CCS, both as technologies for electricity generation and biofuel production. BECCS combines the dual challenge of large-scale biomass production and large-scale storage of CO2. 18 The feasibility of each component of BECCS is uncertain, and their combination is therefore even less certain at this stage. An alternative approach for net negative emissions would be the direct air capture of CO2 followed by geological storage. Air capture refers to technologies that extract CO2 from the atmosphere at the ambient concentration of CO2 (i.e. 400 ppm). The advantage of direct air capture is that it can be done anywhere without the need for transport of the CO2 to a storage site. A disadvantage is that the process of isolating and removing the CO2 from air at low ambient concentrations is technically challenging, currently expensive, and unproven at scale. roadmaps have been used successfully There are strong reasons to believe that the necessary technologies for deep decarbonization are within reach from an engineering and cost standpoint. But their commercial readiness needs to be accelerated by providing appropriate policy support and by building public-private partnerships on RDD&D. Effective global strategies for deep decarbonization must include strategies for promoting the development and diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Previous examples of successful technology RDD&D share a number of characteristics: clear goals and timelines for technology performance were set; public and private actors organized around long-term technology roadmaps; industry both competed and cooperated to identify promising lines of inquiry and demonstration; grants were issued on a highly competitive basis; and intellectual property was frequently shared or open source. Key RDD&D mechanisms include technology roadmaps and technology roundtables. They complement market-based instruments for low-carbon transition such as carbon taxation, emissions permit systems, and regulations. Technology including semiconductors and genetics, to identify priorities for research and technology development. Such roadmaps help mobilize and organize the public and private players in expert communities around shared priorities and ensure effective use of scarce resources for RDD&D. They will be a key tool in driving directed technological innovation for low-carbon technologies. The scope and content of these technology roadmaps should be frequently updated, to make sure the necessary RDD&D push does not preclude any technology that could play a role in the achievement of cost-effective emissions reduction in every sector. Multi-stakeholder technology roundtables can develop these technology roadmaps. Such roundtables should gather governments, businesses, investors, and other critical stakeholders with an interest in a particular technology. The roundtables would prepare and update technology roadmaps, identify priority areas for public and private RDD&D, and mobilize public and private funds for RDD&D. As one example, the IEA has been operating technology roundtables for key energy technologies. in many technology areas, 19 The objective of developing country-level DDPs ....................................................................... 20 5.1 5.2 Backcasting approach consistent with the 2C target ............................................................... 21 5.2.1 Not a burden-sharing approach .................................................................................................. 21 5.2.2 Level of per capita emissions by 2050 as a benchmark, not as a target ................................... 21 Sectoral performance indicators as benchmarks, not as targets .............................................. 22 5.2.3 Bottom-up approach, with transparent technological assumptions ......................................... 23 5.3 5.4 Summary of general assumptions .............................................................................................. 25 The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) is a collaborative initiative to understand and show how countries can transition to a low-carbon economy and how the world can meet the internationally agreed objective of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature to less than 2C. Currently the DDPP comprises 15 Country Research Teams composed of leading researchers and research institutions from some of the worlds top emitting countries, representing more than 70% of global GHG emissions and at different stages of development: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. Each DDPP Country Research Team develops a pathway for deep decarbonization, with the intent of taking into account their countrys socio-economic conditions, development aspirations, infrastructure stocks, natural resources endowments, and other relevant factors. The DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams presented in this report are intended to provide a complementary analysis to existing global-level studies of deep emissions reductions. Prior to the DDPP, only a few countries had studied pathways with emissions reductions large enough by 2050 to be consistent with the objective of staying within the 2C limit. Global studies, including those by IPCC and IEA, have offered a framework for analyzing of deep decarbonization at a high level and have identified total worldwide emission reduction trajectories that would be consistent with particular temperature change limits, including 2C. Global studies also highlight common actions and technological challenges associated with deep decarbonization across many regions. On their own, however, global studies can be insufficient to make a clear and convincing case for action at the country level. At times, the assumptions underlying global studies may be inconsistent with individual countries socio-economic development objectives and may lack enough granularity on individual countrys economic sectors and existing infrastructure to present a technical roadmap for policy implementation at the country level. This interim report of the DDPP focuses on an initial analysis of the technical feasibility of DDPs within each country. The 2015 DDPP Report will refine the analysis of the technical decarbonization potential, exploring options for even deeper decarbonization, and also better taking into account existing infrastructure stocks. At this stage will have not yet looked in detail at the issue of the costs and 20 benefits of mitigation actions, nor considered the question of who should pay for them. The 2015 DDPP report will also take a broader perspective, and go beyond technical feasibility, to analyze in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches, and implementation. This chapter describes the methodology adopted by the consortium of 15 Country Research Teams of the DDPP for the technical feasibility stage of the analysis. identify policy frameworks for The term backcasting is used to denote a process in which a target is fixed for a future date, and then a pathway towards achieving the target is identified by moving backward in time. Our project falls squarely within the backcasting framework. We have taken the 2C limit in global temperature increase as the target; translated this target into a global CO2-energy budget for the period 2011-50, a 2050 per- capita emissions benchmark, and sectoral performance indicators benchmarks; and the Country Research Teams explored pathways to 2050 that would be line with both the global target and their own national circumstances. We have not allocated the cumulative CO2-energy global budget across countries, but rather have used it as a benchmark for exploring DDPs. In past international climate negotiations, government officials have struggled to reconcile different views on how to fairly divide a certain global carbon budget or GHG emissions reduction target into national carbon budgets. These disagreements include whether or how to take into account historic emissions, the potential options and cost for mitigation, and the basis for GHG accounting rules. Such disagreements over the equitable sharing of global mitigation efforts have been a stumbling block for many years in UNFCCC negotiations, leading to insufficient international action to date. The DDPP has sought to de-emphasize the contentious question on precise allocation of individual budgets or targets, and instead to focus on common, bold actions that will be eventually needed within nearly all countries. The plain fact is that, regardless of the precise allocation rules on GHG emissions, to stay within the 2C limit every major emitting country will have to undertake a deep transformation of their energy systems to low-carbon energy by 2050. To guide the exploration of their DDPs, the Country Research Teams used a 2050 global average per capita emissions level as a benchmark but not as a target in a strict sense. For the purposes of developing the DDPP 2050 benchmark, we have chosen the IEA 2DS scenario as our reference scenario. Globally, the cumulative emissions trajectory from the IEA 2DS results in a 50% chance of staying within the 2C limit, and the 2DS scenario reaches 15 Gt of CO2-energy by 2050. This 2050 level translates to a benchmark of 1.6 tons of CO2-energy emissions per capita by 2050, assuming a global population of 9.5 billion by 2050, in line with the medium fertility projection of the UN Population Division. The reason for this choice was not to constrain the analysis within a 50% chance of staying within the 2C limit. In fact, during the next phase the Country Research Teams will explore further options for deep decarbonization, and they could lead to a higher than 50% chance of staying within 21 the 2C limit. But the IEA is a key DDPP Partner Organization and has shared the global assumptions and country results of the 2DS with the Country Research Teams to assist them in the development of their own DDPs. The reason why the convergence of per capita emissions by 2050 cannot be used as a single criterion for the equitable allocation of the global carbon budget across countries is that it fails to capture important differences across countries related either to their technical potential for decarbonization, capabilities to implement mitigation actions, existing economic structure and energy infrastructure, or historical and cumulative emissions. While recognizing these important limitations, it provides a useful benchmark to guide the exploration of country-level DDPs. Indeed, very few countries with CO2-energy per capita above 1.6 tons today will be able to go far below this level by 2050. On the other hand, catch-up economic growth in low-income countries that currently emit less than 1.6 tCO2 per capita will increase their per capita emissions by 2050, even as they decrease the carbon intensity of their economic growth. As a consequence, if very few countries can go below 1.6 tons of CO2-energy emissions per capita by 2050, and very few countries can be significantly above, then all countries should converge close to the global average. In addition to the level of per capita emissions by 2050, the Country Research Teams have also used sectoral performance indicators to guide the exploration of their DDPs. Compared to per capita emissions, sectoral performance indicators are a better way to account for countries structural differences. For example, by using this indicator, a country could have higher emissions per capita than the world average, not as a result of lower efforts to decarbonize its industry, but as a consequence of a higher share of industry in its GDP than the world average. We have used the scenarios reviewed by the IPCC AR5 WG3 to define sectoral performance indicators for power generation, buildings, transport, and industry consistent with the 2C limit. As the convergence of per capita emissions, sectoral performance indicators have important limitations and do not account for possible limitations in the technical mitigation potential, different capacities to implement these actions, or historical and cumulative emissions. But we have used them to ensure that their sectoral strategies in the DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams were thoroughly evaluated. 22 Table 5.1 Range and median value of sectoral performance indicators in the IPCC 2C scenarios Sector Sub-sector / Region Indicator Power generation Buildings Transport _ OECD EIT Asia Africa & ME Latin America Passenger transport Freight transport Total Transport Cement Industry Iron and steel Carbon intensity of power generation (gCO2/kWh) Final energy demand per capita in buildings (GJ) Energy intensity of passenger transport (GJ/p-km, index 1=2010 value) Energy intensity of freight transport (GJ/t-km, index 1=2010 value) Carbon intensity of (tC02/GJ, index 1=2010 value) Carbon intensity of industrial production Paper (tCO2/ton industrial product) Benchmark in Benchmark in 2050 2050 Median value Range 20 -30  50 37.2 31.6 11.6 10.3 11.8 29  43 25  42 9.7  13.8 9.7  13 10.4  15.2 0.75 0.58  0.78 0.65 0.45  0.9 0.7 0.6  0.85 _ _ _ 0.24  0.39 0.47  0.84 0.16  0.20 A key element of the DDPP approach was to define a common set of shared assumptions across countries, in particular those regarding the availability of technologies that are not yet commercially available. As discussed in detail in chapter IV, achieving deep decarbonization indeed rests on the accelerated deployment at scale of technologies that are not yet commercially available or not currently competitive with conventional technologies. Achieving full commercialization of these technologies is 23 often beyond the reach of any individual country or company. The DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams assume that the world invests massively, through public and private partnerships, in the development and early deployment of these technologies. Only these assumptions made it possible for Country Research Teams to project that the technologies they needed to achieve deep decarbonization would be available to them. Table 5.2. Shared technological assumptions in the DDPP for when improved low-carbon technologies will become available for deployment at scale Sector Technology Starting date of deployment at scale Power Transport Industry CCS (coal and gas) Advanced geothermal 2025 - 2030 2025 - 2030 Advanced energy storage 2030 - 2035 IV gen nuclear 2035 - 2040 Global availability of long range EVs across all vehicle types 2020 - 2025 Second generation biofuels 2020 - 2025 Hydrogen fuel cells 2030 - 2035 CCS in industry (close to pure CO2 streams) Electric boilers and process heaters 2020 - 2025 2020 - 2025 The depth and breadth of technology deployment strongly depends on country-specific circumstances (including the availability of alternative technological options, the infrastructure to support the deployment of technologies, and public acceptance and support). All of these technologies did not have to be deployed by the dates listed in each and every DDP. But Country Research Teams had the option to utilize the technologies if their country has the physical potential (e.g. geological potential for carbon storage) and if the technologies were necessary and cost-effective to achieve the objective of deep decarbonization. Moreover, we emphasize that the DDPP is still at an interim stage in considering the full range of technology options. There is continued debate around certain technologies such as the future of CCS, fourth-generation nuclear power, and advanced biofuels, both among the Country Research Teams and more generally. We will therefore base the 2015 report on a more detailed and considered assessment of the timing, scalability, and financing of the various low-carbon technology options. 24 To summarize, the national deep decarbonization pathways produced by the DDPP Country Research Teams are based on a number of assumptions and enabling conditions:  All countries take strong, early and coordinated actions to combat climate change.  All countries operate in a supportive global policy environment that is firmly directed at the 2C limit.  There is ample public-private partnership and cooperation to enable the rapid development, demonstration, and diffusion of the requisite low-carbon technologies in all key sectors.  Open global markets ensure the global diffusion of low-carbon technologies and their cost reduction through scale and learning effects.  Major global cooperative efforts speed technology development and improve the reach and performance of low-carbon technologies, ranging from renewables to nuclear power to CCS to energy efficiency.  Financial flows are re-directed from high-carbon to low-carbon portfolios and projects.  Financial support is provided implicitly to countries with lower capacities to implement mitigation policies and finance low-carbon investments, though such support is not modeled in this phase of the project. Low-carbon technologies become available and affordable to all countries, for example through a technology cooperation mechanism and fund. Previous studies have frequently assumed the use of large quantities of offsets to minimize costs. The implicit assumption is that large emitters could fund emissions reductions in low-emitting countries in exchange for reducing the need for local reductions. As noted previously, this assumption becomes unlikely under global deep decarbonization scenario in line with 2C limit, as all countries will have to make real efforts to come close to the 1.6 tons per capita global average or sectoral performance indicator benchmarks. For this reason, we did not explore global offsets in the national scenarios. We assume that the volume of such offsets will at best be relatively small. 25 Introduction ................................................................................................................................. 26 6.1 Deep decarbonization in the context of sustainable development ............................................ 26 6.2 Economic growth assumptions .................................................................................................. 26 6.2.1 Energy demand ........................................................................................................................... 27 6.2.2 Aggregate results ........................................................................................................................ 28 6.3 Examining the pillars of deep decarbonization at country level ................................................. 31 6.4 Sectoral strategies ....................................................................................................................... 31 6.5 Sectoral shares of total emissions .............................................................................................. 31 6.5.1 6.5.2 Power generation: switch to low-carbon electricity ................................................................... 32 6.5.3 Residential buildings ................................................................................................................... 33 6.5.4 Passenger transport .................................................................................................................... 34 Freight transport .......................................................................................................................... 36 6.5.5 Industry ........................................................................................................................................ 38 6.5.6 6.6 Areas for further analysis ............................................................................................................. 39 All results presented in this chapter are drawn directly from the DDPs developed by the 15 Country Research Teams. These results are preliminary: they represent an initial analysis of the technical feasibility of DDPs within each country. No definitive judgments based on the details of the country DDPs or their aggregate results should therefore be drawn at this stage. The focus in the country analyses was on achieving deep reductions in CO2 emissions in 2050. These preliminary analyses will be revised in the coming months to explore the options for even deeper decarbonization pathways, better take into account the existing infrastructure stocks, and focuse more on CO2 emissions trajectories and cumulative CO2 emissions from 2010-2050. The full costs of the DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams have not yet been examined in detail. But the DDPs are based on socio-economic assumptions, which reflect each Country Research Teams vision of its national development trajectory to 2050. All 15 DDPs assume continuedand for some countries rapideconomic growth to 2050. Assumed GDP growth rates are especially strong in todays middle-income economies, which start from lower levels of GDP per capita than high-income countries today and therefore have room for catch-up 26 growth (Figure 6.1). As a result of sustained economic growth, all 15 DDPs anticipate higher levels of GDP per capita in 2050 than South Korea today. Across the 15 DDPs, average energy consumption per capita converges to two metric tons of oil equivalent (toe) by 2050 (Figure 6.2). It declines in absolute terms in high-income countries, where energy efficiency improvements outweigh population and GDP growth. In middle-income countries, on the other hand, energy consumption increases in absolute terms as a result of improved energy access and rapid GDP growth, in part driven by energy-intensive industries. However, this increase is lower than it would otherwise be because of improvements in energy efficiency. 27 All 15 DDPs achieve very significant reductions in CO2energy emissions by 2050. In aggregate, CO2 energy emissions from the 15 DDPs fall to 12.3 Gt by 2050, which is a 45% reduction from the 22.3 Gt that these 15 countries emitted in 2010 (Figure 6.3). This decline in CO2energy emissions is even more significant when accounting for continued population and GDP growth over the 2010-2050 period. Across the 15 DDPs, population and GDP (in 2005 US$) are expected to grow by 21% and 346%, respectively, from 2010-2050. In aggregate, the 15 DDPs thus achieve a 56% decrease in per capita CO2energy emissions (from 5.4 tCO2energy to 2.4 tCO2energy per capita) and a 88% decline in the CO2energy intensity of GDP (from 464 to 55 tCO2 per $ GDP) by mid-century (Figures 6.4 and 6.5). This corresponds to an average 2% annual decrease of emissions per capita and a 5.2% annual decrease of emissions per unit of GDP over 2010-2050. In aggregate, the 15 DDPs also represent a very significant departure from current trends. Between 2000 and 2010, average per capita CO2energy emissions increased by 1.1% per year, and CO2energy intensity of GDP decreased by only 1.5% per year. In the aggregate DDP, trends in total and per capita emissions are reversed, and the declining trend in CO2energy intensity of GDP is accelerated. 28 The aggregate DDP also marks a very significant departure from projected trends under business as usual (BAU) trajectories or weak climate policy scenarios. The DDPP Country Research Teams did not produce BAU scenarios of their own, as the focus instead was on DDPs. For an illustrative comparison, we look to the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) scenarios, which are available for 7 of the 15 countries covered by the DDPP: Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the U.S. These 7 countries represent 78% of the total emissions from our 15 countries in 2010 and 92% of total projected emissions in 2050, which makes the comparison meaningful:  The IEA 6C Scenario (6DS) is largely an extension of current trends. In the absence of efforts to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, average global temperature is projected to rise at least 6C in the long term.  The 4C Scenario (4DS) takes into account recent pledges made by countries to limit emissions and step up efforts to improve energy efficiency. It serves as the primary benchmark in ETP 2014 when comparisons are made among scenarios and it projects a long-term temperature rise of 4C.  The 2C Scenario (2DS) is the main focus of ETP 2014. It describes an energy system consistent with an emissions trajectory that recent climate science research indicates would give at least a 50% chance of limiting average global temperature increase to 2C. Our seven country DDPs achieve a roughly 70% reduction in 2050 CO2energy emissions relative to an extension of current trends (6DS), a more than halving of 2050 emissions relative to recently promised mitigation efforts (4DS), and are close to, but slightly higher than, the 2DS (Figure 6.6). 29 Note: The comparison only includes the DDPs for Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the USA to match the countries analyzed as part of the IEA scenarios. It is still too early for the DDPP to compare the cumulative emissions from our 15 DDPs with the global CO2energy budget for 20112050 to have a likely chance of staying within the 2C limit. As already emphasized, the primary focus of the analysis at this stage was reaching the lowest possible level of emissions in 2050, driven by our per capita emissions and sectoral performance indicators benchmarks, not the lowest possible level of cumulative emissions to 2050. Under reasonable assumptions for the rest of the world, the 2050 level of emissions of our 15 DDPs is still too high to give a 50% chance of keeping below 2C. As the comparison with the IEA 2DS scenario for a subset of 7 of our countries also shows, our DDPs have higher emissions during the 2011-2050 period, not only by 2050. As a consequence, the cumulative emissions from our 15 DDPs is also certainly higher than the global CO2 energy budget for 20112050 to have a 50% chance of staying within the 2C limit. But this should not be interpreted as proving that strong early mitigation actions such as those in the IEA 2DS are impossible; it is only a consequence of the methodology adopted at this stage, focusing on the 2050 level of emissions. Given the purpose of the analysis at this stage, we are encouraged by the initial results, which show that the decarbonization achieved by 2050 is already very substantial and well on its way to becoming consistent with the 2C limit. In the coming months, DDPP Country Research Teams will explore options for even deeper decarbonization pathways and will pay more attention to the management of the transition to 2050, with the objective of lowering cumulative emissions. The interim DDPs developed by the Country Research Teams help to illuminate key elements of deep decarbonization strategies across countries, the main options in different countries, and the most important challenges moving forward. The rest of the chapter presents and discusses these preliminary findings. 30 All 15 DDPs share three common pillars for the deep decarbonization of their national energy systems: energy efficiency, low-carbon electricity, and switching to low-carbon fuels. All 15 DDPs achieve a large decrease in CO2 intensity of GDP (tCO2 emitted per $ GDP) by 2050 compared to 2010: 88% on average. This is the result of the combined effects of: (1) a decrease in the final energy intensity of GDP (toe consumed per $ GDP)16 and (2) a decrease in the CO2 intensity of energy (tCO2 emitted per toe of final energy consumed). On average, the energy intensity of GDP decreases by 70% between 2010 and 2050, and the CO2 intensity of energy decreases by 60%. The relative importance of these two elements in the DDPs changes over time (Figure 6.7). Reducing energy intensity of GDP is more important in the early phase, while reductions in the CO2 intensity of final energy consumption play a larger role in the long-term. The dynamics in Figure 7 are driven, in part, by the effects of electrification. All Country Research Teams use decarbonization of electricity supply and electrification of energy end uses as a strategy for deep decarbonization, to different extents. In the short-run, electrification only has a small effect on the CO2 intensity of energy, since electricity generation is still rather carbon-intensive. Though electrification plays a big role in the decrease of the CO2 intensity of energy over the longer term as, electricity supply is decarbonized. These kinds of sequencing challenges and their implications for cumulative CO2 emissions will be further explored in the next phases of the DDPP. Across the 15 DDPs, different sectors contribute to different levels of CO2 emission reductions (Figure 6.8). The power sector achieves the largest reduction in emissions, with an 85% reduction in 2010 emissions (8,651 Gt CO2) by 2050 (1,258 Gt CO2). Its share in total emissions falls from 38% to 11%. Direct CO2 emissions from the residential building and passenger transport sectors also fall in absolute 16 The decrease of the final energy intensity of GDP combines technical efficiency and structural economic change towards less energy-intensive activities. 31 terms, by 57% and 58%, respectively, but their share in total emissions decreases only slightly, from 13% to 11% and 11% to 9%, respectively. CO2 emissions from freight transport and industry appear to be relatively more difficult to reduce. Emissions from freight transport increase slightly, by 13%, while industry emissions decrease only by 14%. As a consequence, the share of freight and industry in total emissions increases significantly by 2050, from 7% to 17% and 30% to 52%, respectively. This demonstrates the importance of finding additional and innovative ways to reduce emissions in these two sectors. Electrification and the decarbonization of electricity plays a central role in all 15 DDPs. Electricity has a much larger role in energy supplies. The share of electricity in final energy consumption almost doubles from 2010-2050, rising from 19% to 35%. Power generation is almost completely decarbonized in all countries. On average, the CO2 intensity of power production is reduced by 94%, from 617 gCO2 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2010 to 34 gCO2 per kWh by 2050 (Figure 6.9). To reach such a low level of carbon intensity, power needs to be generated almost exclusively from zero- or low-carbon sources in all countries: renewable energy, nuclear power, or fossil fuels with CCS. Across countries, the DDPs achieve the deep decarbonization of power generation through a diverse mix of low-carbon energy sources because countries have different potential for renewable energy, geological storage capacity for CCS, and social preferences and degrees of public support for nuclear power and CCS (Figure 6.11). But by 2050, almost all electricity in all 15 DDPs is generated from zero- and low-carbon sources (Figure 6.10). 32 Measuring aggregate improvements in the energy efficiency of residential buildings is difficult because of the many uses of energy in buildings, such as heating, cooling, cooking, and appliances. The relative importance of these energy uses varies both between and within countries, in part due to differences in climatic conditions. Energy efficiency indicators (e.g., energy use per square meter or per capita) are thus imperfect for cross-country comparison and are not reported here. For the CO2 intensity of residential energy use, all 15 DDPs show a significant decrease (Figure 6.12), driven primarily by increased electrification of residential energy in most countries (Figure 6.13) and increased use of solar thermal energy and combined heat and power (CHP) in others. 33 Among the 15 DDPs, most high-income countries see a modest reduction (Canada, France, U.S.) or a small increase (Australia, Japan, Korea, UK) in passenger mobility (passenger kilometers traveled per capita) between 2010 and 2050 (Figure 6.14). Russia, the only high-income country with low 2010 levels of passenger mobility, sees a large increase in mobility that brings it more in line with other high-income countries. Some middle-income countries (e.g., China, India) see a sharp increase in passenger mobility, converging to levels that match, or are close to, todays high-income countries. In other middle-income countries (e.g., Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa), increases in passenger mobility are more moderate. 34 All 15 DDPs achieve a sharp decrease in the energy intensity of passenger transport (toe per passenger kilometers traveled) (Figure 6.15), combined with a decrease in the CO2 intensity of energy used for passenger transport (tCO2 per toe of final energy consumed) (Figure 6.16). The electrification of passenger vehicles plays an important role in decarbonizing the energy used in passenger transport, but Country Research Teams use other decarbonization strategies as well, including biofuels and fuel cell vehicles powered by renewable hydrogen. 35 All 15 DDPs (except one) decouple freight mobility (freight ton-kilometers) from GDP growth (Figure 6.17). However, total CO2 emissions from freight transport increase because reductions in the energy intensity of freight transport (toe per ton-kilometer traveled) and the CO2 intensity of freight transport energy (tCO2 emitted per toe) are relatively small (Figures 6.18 and 6.19). The 15 DDPs illustrate that, in general, freight transport is more difficult to decarbonize than passenger transport. Although there are several options for reducing the CO2 intensity of freight transport electrification, compressed or liquefied low-carbon gas, modal shifts, and sustainable biofuelsthey all face challenges in deploying at the scale needed to achieve significant CO2 reductions. The results from these preliminary DDPs underscore the importance of a strong global R&D push on technologies and strategies to reduce CO2 emissions in freight transport. Beyond technology, the sector should also explore ways to organize freight transport differently (through modal shifts) and to reduce the need for freight transport through optimized production, consumption, and transportation patterns. 36 37 As with residential buildings, measuring aggregate energy efficiency in industry is difficult because of the diversity of sub-sectors within industry. National comparisons are difficult because of differences in industrial sector composition between countries and the complex nature of the modern global trading system. Nevertheless, there are similarities in decarbonization strategies across countries. All 15 DDPs include aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption in industry. Using three main strategieselectrification, fuel switching, and CCS most DDPs achieve large reductions in the CO2 intensity of energy used in industry (Figure 6.20). Electricitys share of industrial final energy consumption increases significantly across all countries (Figure 6.21). Even with reductions in energy CO2 intensity in industry, aggregate industrial emissions in the 15 DDPs rise over time. By 2050, industrial emissions account for 51% of total emissions, up from 31% in 2010. These results suggest the importance of developing innovative technology pathways for reducing CO2 emissions from key industrial sectors (i.e., tCO2 per ton output), as well as the less materials-intensive production methods (i.e., requiring fewer tons of materials) and less carbon-intensive production materials. 38 The DDPP results thus far, while preliminary, illustrate both the technical possibilities and the challenges for deep decarbonization across a wide range of national contexts. As a next step, and before we quantify the costs and benefits of decarbonization, identify national and international finance requirements, analyze in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches, and map out the policy frameworks for implementation, the DDPP Country Research Teams will explore four areas that were not included in the first round of analysis of the technically feasibility. First, the Country Research Teams will explore a greater array of technology options, including some that are still at the pre-commercial stage. So far, they have incorporated emerging technologies and energy system configurations to different extents in their analyses, and there is likely still potential to 39 further reduce CO2 emissions per unit of activity (e.g., CO2 per passenger kilometer traveled) in the DDPs, although the feasibility of technology deployment at the national level will have to be examined carefully. Second, teams will further explore energy drivers in their models through scenario analysis. Most of the DDPs are based on conservative assumptions about activity drivers, and reducing the level of these drivers will reduce CO2 emissions (e.g., reductions in passenger kilometers traveled will reduce CO2 emissions from passenger transport). Third, teams will consider in further details the issue of infrastructure stocks, Fourth, teams will estimate cumulative CO2 emissions from 2010-2050, rather than focusing only on a single year (2050). An important outcome of the DDPP so far is that it has fostered interactive learning and a cooperative problem-solving mindset among technical and macroeconomic assumptions, sectoral expertise, and data sources. The backcasting approach, which was new to many of the Country Research Teams, created a framework for innovative thinking and produced creative results. Over the eight months since the project began, including several face-to-face meetings, this process has led to the development of much more ambitious DDPs than found in many previous studies of national mitigation potential. This interim report is only a start. But it is our hope that this report, as well as the more comprehensive report to be published during the first half of 2015, will make a useful contribution to the debate by spurring the development and international comparison of country-level DDPs and by promoting the global cooperation required to achieve them. the participants.

The full set of 15 country chapters will be included in the full 2014 DDPP report to be published in September. 41 Australia is a mid-sized developed economy with high per capita greenhouse gas emissions. Exports of energy, minerals, and agricultural commodities have always played an important role in the Australian economy, with the relative importance of specific commodities changing over the decades in response to international demand. Australia has abundant renewable and non-renewable energy resources and relatively easily recoverable reserves of coal, gas, and uranium. Australia is one of the leading exporters of coal and domestic coal production is forecast to continue to increase.2 With a number of liquefaction projects under construction, the country is also set to soon become the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG).3 In addition, Australia is a major supplier of minerals such as bauxite, alumina, iron ore, uranium, copper, and lithium. Australias abundant renewable energy resources and significant sequestration potential through carbon plantings could be harnessed under decarbonization. Australias economy is highly emissions-intensive due to the extensive use of coal in electricity supply. Electricity accounts for two-thirds of Australias greenhouse gas emissions with coal fired power accounting for 69% of generation and gas providing a further 19%. The remainder is mostly supplied by renewable energy technologies, including hydroelectricity (6%), wind (2%), bioenergy (1%), and solar photovoltaic (PV) (1%).4 Australia exports uranium but does not generate any electricity from nuclear power. 2 BREE, 2014. Australia is the worlds largest exporter of metallurgical coal and the second largest thermal coal exporter by volume. 3 BREE, 2014. Seven new liquefied natural gas liquefaction facilities are expected to enter the export market by 2022. 4 BREE, 2013a. Oil and other sources (including multi-fuel fired power plants) contribute 2%. On average, solar PV and wind have grown 95% and 20% over the past five years, respectively. The data is for 2011/12. 42 Service industries, including education, tourism, and finance are important in Australias economy, contributing more than half of Australias GDP. The competitiveness of exports from these sectors is strongly influenced by exchange rates, and these industries are likely to expand over the medium term. Global deep decarbonization would significantly change demand for Australian exports while domestic decarbonization would require fundamental changes in Australias energy system over the coming decades. These changes would present both challenges and opportunities for Australia, both within the energy sector and more widely. Australias per capita emissions are among the highest in the world. This is due to:  The predominance of coal-fired generation in Australias electricity supply;  The relatively large contribution of energy and emissions-intensive industrial activity to the Australian economy;  The historically low cost of energy;  The economic importance of agriculture; and  The long distance transport requirements resulting from the concentration of Australias population in urban centers and large distances between the urban centers. Figure 1a shows Australias 2012 greenhouse gas emissions by source and Figure 1b shows the decomposition of energy-related CO2 emissions (i.e. from fossil fuel combustion). Source: BREE, 2013b, Department of the Environment, 2014. Data variations are due to rounding error. Australias economic circumstances are somewhat unique in the global context insofar as emissions from mining and manufacturing contribute a relatively large share (over one third) of Australias total greenhouse gas emissions, of which about one third are process and fugitive emissions. In addition, about 15% of Australias total emissions are attributable to agriculture, including methane emissions from livestock. Figure 2 shows the proportional contribution of industry sectors to Australias total greenhouse gas emissions, GDP, and export revenues. 43 Source: ABS, 2012; Department of the Environment, 2014. However, Australia has made some recent progress in decarbonizing its economy. Over the past two decades Australias greenhouse gas emissions have remained stable while the size of the economy has almost doubled. As a result, the emissions intensity of Australias GDP has nearly halved and emissions per capita have decreased by approximately 25% over this period (see Figure 3f). Increasing emissions from energy use were roughly offset by reduced deforestation and increased plantation forestry. Since 2008/09, emissions from fuel combustion have stabilized, driven by a significant expansion in renewable energy, a drop in demand for grid-supplied electricity, and a tripling in the rate of energy efficiency improvement in large industrial companies. Rising energy prices and government programs and policies (including standards and subsidies for energy efficiency, carbon pricing, and support programs for renewable energy) have helped achieve this outcome. 44 Source: ABS, 2012, 2013; BREE, 2013b; Department of the Environment, 2014. Note: Figure 3a and 3b for international comparison. Australia has a broad range of options for decarbonizing its economy and multiple possible pathways could be modelled. However the analysis in this report describes and presents results for one illustrative pathway in line with the global project parameters and methodology. The modelling for the illustrative pathway prioritizes continued economic growth and focuses on technological solutions, with less emphasis on change in economic structure or consumption patterns beyond current projections. 45 Assumptions about the availability and cost of technologies are deliberately conservative in the context of a decarbonizing world. Potential step changes in technology and economic structure are not included in the example pathway but are being explored qualitatively. The possibility that some technologies included in the example pathway are not available, or end up being more costly than assumed in the modelling, has been explored in section 2.3. The analysis builds on previous Australian work, including Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) power, land, and transport sector modelling.5 It has also been informed by the feedback gathered via consultation with over 40 industry and academic experts, which identified that stakeholder views diverge on the viability, likely extent and costs of options such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), carbon forestry, and bioenergy. Australia can maintain economic growth and prosperity, and decarbonize by 2050. The results from the illustrative pathway show that between now and 2050, real GDP grows at 2.4% per year on average, resulting in an economy nearly 150% larger than today. Productivity keeps rising, with 43% growth in real wages and exports growing at 3.5% per annum. Table 1 summarizes the economic and population growth trajectory. However economic growth is not uniform across the economy. Growth driven by the increase in activities such as renewable energy generation and forestry is offset by significant reductions in primary industries such as coal production, oil extraction, and heavy manufacturing. This is discussed in section 2.1.2 under the Industry heading. Table 1. Development Indicators and Energy Service Demand Drivers 2040 2012 2050 Population [millions] GDP per capita [$A/capita] 2020 2030 22.72 25.53 29.17 32.62 36.01 65,715 72,240 80,862 91,291 102,677 In 2012, Australias energy related emissions were approximately 17 tCO2 per capita and for Australia to contribute to the objective of limiting global temperature to <2C, this would need to decrease by an order of magnitude by 2050. In the illustrative pathway, Australias energy-related emissions are substantially reduced to 3.0 tCO2 per capita in 2050, and are lower still at 1.6 tCO2 per capita if emissions directly attributable to the production of exports are excluded. Within the modelling parameters of the illustrative pathway, including the forecast growth in global demand for energy and mineral commodities,6 deeper decarbonization of Australias energy-related emissions would likely require technological advances that increase the viability and/or reduce the cost of decarbonization options. 5 Graham et al., 2013; Reedman & Graham, 2013. 6 IEA, 2009, 2012. 46 Australias total primary energy use decreases by 21% from 2012 to 2050 while final energy use increases by 22% (see Figure 4a and 4b). There are significant changes in the fuel mix; coal use is almost entirely phased out (the only remaining use is for coking coal in iron and steel), and there is an increase in renewables and biomass, and gas use. Australias energy-related CO2 emissions pathway from 2012 to 2050 is shown in Figure 5a to 5c. Note: For international comparison. 47 Decarbonization of energy transformation (mainly electricity generation) combined with electrification (supplied by decarbonized electricity) and fuel switching leads to nearly a 75% reduction in the emissions intensity of energy use across all economic sectors. The contribution of these pillars is shown in Figure 6b, while a description is provided below:  Structural change: The illustrative pathway only assumes changes in economic and/or industrial structures that occur in response to domestic and global macroeconomic trends. These include global demand for commodities, existing and emerging trends in consumer preferences, continued growth of the service sector, and a plateauing of distance travelled per capita in cars and other modes of transport. In combination, these changes lead to a halving of final energy use per dollar of real GDP by 2050.  Energy efficiency: Energy efficiency is assumed to continue to improve at current rates until 2020, but accelerates thereafter, especially in the building and transport sectors.  Electrification and fuel switching: Electrification becomes widespread, especially for cars, buildings and industrial processes such as heating processes or material handling. Thermal coal use in industry is considerably reduced via a shift to gas and biomass wherever possible. Freight fuels move away from diesel with a significant shift to gas.  Decarbonization of energy transformation: Electricity generation is almost completely decarbonized via 100% renewable grid-integrated supply of electricity, with some on-site gas fired electricity generation particularly in remote (non-grid integrated) areas. Other mixes of technologies for electricity generation are modelled as variants (refer to section 2.3). There is significant replacement of direct fossil fuel use with bioenergy. 48 Note: For international comparison. The illustrative pathway includes considerable reductions in non-energy emissions, including industrial process and fugitive emissions. The modelling assumes that best practice is applied in farming and livestock production, and that global beef demand decreases slightly in response to increases in price (due to its relatively high emissions intensity and land constraints). Australia has substantial potential to offset emissions via land sector sequestration. The illustrative pathway includes a shift in land use toward carbon forestry, driven by carbon abatement incentives, where profitable for land holders; but it does not include the sale of emissions offsets into overseas markets. Figure 7 shows the underlying drivers of decarbonization (Figure 7b) and the pathway of decarbonization (Figure 7a) for all emissions sources and sinks. 49 After accounting for all emissions sources and sinks, the pathway includes intermediate emissions reductions milestones of 19% below 2000 levels in 2020, at least 50% below 2000 levels in 2030, and to net zero emissions by 2050. The cumulative emissions to 2050 are compatible with Australias carbon budget recommended by Australias Climate Change Authority,7 an independent body established under the Climate Change Act 2011. This would require strong mitigation action in all sectors of the economy, in the context of a strong global decarbonization effort. The trajectory of decarbonization pathways varies substantially among sectors, depending on the availability and relative cost of technologies required in each sector. In 2050, industry is the largest contributor to energy emissions, due to continued high levels of activity in mining and manufacturing, followed by transport (see Figures 7 and 8). Nearly half of Australias energy emissions in 2050 are directly attributable to exports, mostly for production of industrial commodities (see Figure 8). By 2050, fuel combustion emissions reduce by about 80% compared to 2012. The main contributor to Australias non-energy emissions in 2050 is agriculture, as currently there are limited options for reducing emissions from the agricultural sector. Sequestration via carbon forestry of approximately 7 tCO2e per person is required for Australia to achieve zero net emissions (see Figure 8). Electrification across all sectors drives a two and one-half fold increase in electricity demand by 2050, however the substantial change in Australias electricity generation mix leads to a greater than 95% reduction in the emissions intensity of electricity to 0.021 tCO2/MWh. In 2050, 84% of electricity demand is met by grid-integrated renewable energy generation, mostly from rooftop and large scale solar photovoltaic panels, onshore wind, enhanced geothermal systems, wave, 7 Climate Change Authority, 2014. 50 biomass, and solar thermal generation (see Figure 9). This is possible through the inclusion of both flexible and variable renewable energy technologies as well as advances in energy storage technologies, which would also be widely used in the transport sector.8 The remaining electricity demand is met by distributed supply, mostly from renewable energy generation with one quarter (or 4% of total demand) supplied by on-site gas fired electricity generation in remote (non-grid integrated) areas. The mix of power generation technologies modelled for the illustrative pathway is based on work by the (CSIRO).9 Depending on the Commonwealth Scientific and development of technologies, costs and regulatory frameworks, a near-zero emissions power system could comprise different energy sources and mixes (variants are explored in section 2.3). Industrial Research Organisation By 2050, industrial energy emissions decrease by nearly 60% while the economic value added of industrial activities more than doubles. Metal ores, metals, and gas contribute nearly two thirds of the 8 This can be thought of as a co-benefit or spill-over effect whereby a sector is unintentionally impacted by an action taken by another sector. 9 Electricity generation plant technology performance and costs are based on BREE (2012, 2013c), and the capital cost reduction time path developed by Hayward & Graham (2012). 51 total industrial energy-related emissions in 2050, and 80% of these emissions are attributable to commodities produced for exports. Across the mining sector, energy intensity doubles instead of tripling or quadrupling (in the absence of energy efficiency improvements). At the same time, manufacturing sector energy efficiency improvements continue in line with recent trends for the first two decades then capital stock replacements by more energy efficient stock drive increased energy efficiency. Industrial processes are electrified where feasible, and there is a shift from coal to gas and increased use of bioenergy (Figure 10a). Process emissions and fugitive emissions are reduced via various means including process improvements, materials substitution, the partial use of bio-coke in iron and steel production, increased combustion/catalyzation of gases with high global warming potential, and CCS. CCS is also applied to industrial process and fugitive emissions, as well as to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion for the liquefaction of natural gas, where it has been applied for fugitive emissions. Global decarbonization drives changes in global demand for commodities. In particular, reduced demand for coal10 and oil is expected to drive decreases in coal and oil production of 60% and 30% respectively. For some manufacturing activities, including metals production (iron, steel, and iron ore) growth slows, and consequently their proportional contribution to economic activity decreases. Conversely, demand for non-ferrous metals and other minerals such as uranium and lithium is expected to increase. In addition, some domestic trends are estimated to continue, such as the progressive closure of all oil refining capacity in Australia  approximately one-third of this capacity is expected to be substituted by biofuel refining. Figure 10a shows the industry energy demand by fuel source. 10 For the illustrative pathway, Australias production of coal is assumed to decrease in line with global demand. Further analysis could be conducted in the future on the relative competitiveness of the Australian coal industry in a decarbonizing world, which could help refine estimates of future Australian coal production. 52 Greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and residential buildings reduce by 95% to 2050 due to significant energy efficiency, electrification of direct fuel use (e.g. gas for heating), and the use of decarbonized electricity. Energy use per square meter of commercial building and per residential dwelling decreases by approximately 50%. There is strong growth in distributed, grid integrated electricity generation, in particular rooftop solar PV. Figure 10b shows the building energy demand trajectory. A substantial shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric and hybrid vehicles, and to a lesser extent hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, results in over 70% improvement in the energy efficiency of cars and light commercial vehicles. Gas is used extensively for road freight. As a result, oil use for road transport decreases by 85% between 2012 and 2050 while vehicle kilometers travelled nearly double. Biofuels replace 50% of oil use in aviation, as this is one of the only decarbonization options currently available for this sector. Figure 10c shows the transport energy demand trajectory and Figure 11 shows the composition of drive train technologies from 2012 to 2050 for cars and light commercial vehicles, and the fuel mix for freight and aviation over the same period. 53 Soil and livestock emissions are reduced through the implementation of best practice farming techniques, in particular for beef (e.g. intensification of breeding, improvement in feeding and pasture practices, as well as enhanced breeding and herd selection for lower livestock methane emissions). In addition, a small relative reduction in beef demand is expected to result from increases in beef prices in a decarbonized world. Together, these factors drive a 45% reduction in emissions intensity of agricultural activity. However, this is not sufficient to compensate for the growth in activity that sees agricultural emissions grow by 20% between today and 2050. Some of this production, and the associated emissions, is attributable to exports. Feedstocks for the production of bioenergy are sourced from agricultural and forestry residues and wastes, dedicated energy crops, and grasslands, and are used primarily in the aviation and mining sectors. The increases in agriculture and forestry activities required to collect and gather this biomass has been accounted for in the modelling. As already described in section 2.1.1, Australia has great potential to offset emissions via forestry bio- sequestration. Under price incentives for afforestation, large shifts in land use from agricultural land (in particular grasslands) to carbon forestry would become profitable. However, this would require significant development of supply chains as well as regional capabilities and workforces. For the illustrative pathway, the total uptake of carbon forestry was capped by the volume required to meet the budget recommended by Australias Climate Change Authority, equivalent to approximately 40% of the total economic potential identified. 54 The potential for generating energy from renewable resources in Australia is far greater than Australias total energy use today.11 As such, the challenge for Australia is not the availability of renewable resources, but harnessing the potential. Australia also has substantial potential for geological carbon storage with large potential storage basins across the country, including a number in close proximity to fossil fuel reserves and major industrial areas.12 The industrial-scale Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project is one of the worlds largest CCS projects under development; it is expected to commence operation in 2015, and all government approvals for capturing and re-injecting carbon dioxide from the extraction and processing of natural gas have been granted for this project.13 Despite recent increases, Australias rate of energy efficiency improvement is lower than in other major developed economies. Thus, considerable potential for energy efficiency improvements remains and is modelled in the illustrative pathway. Energy efficiency improvements are driven by much higher energy efficiency in the new housing stock (and domestic appliances within) required to be built for Australia's growing population. In addition, many of Australias aging industrial assets are replaced with more energy efficient capital stock by 2050 as part of natural asset life cycles. Transport systems also have significant potential for greater energy efficiency through modal shift and urban planning. The electrification of industrial processes will be necessary for all country pathways and electrification technologies are likely to be a global R&D focus. Large technological advances in the potential for electrification (e.g. heat pumps and conveyors) are assumed, even though many such technologies are not yet available and/or not yet widely deployed. Australias non-energy emissions are substantial compared with other industrialized countries and currently there are very few options for reducing or offsetting a large proportion of non-energy emissions other than the use of bioenergy, CCS, and carbon forestry. Hence these technologies are likely to be critical to Australias decarbonization pathway. Carbon forestry has large potential to offset emissions (more than twice the amount that has been modelled) so it could contribute more to decarbonization in the event that other technologies do not contribute to decarbonization to the extent anticipated. The role of CCS in sequestering industrial process and fugitive emissions, and fuel combustion emissions in LNG production, is highly dependent on CCS being demonstrated as viable (including the long-term risks of fugitive emissions), socially acceptable, and cost-effective, also at smaller scales. 11 AEMO, 2013; see also Geoscience Australia & ABARE, 2010 12 CO2CRC, 2011 13 CCS Institute, 2014; CO2CRC, 2011 55 By reducing total energy demand, energy efficiency improvements enable low carbon energy supply to contribute a greater proportion to total energy supply. Energy efficiency is also the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions. Electrification of industry and the use of bioenergy and/or CCS may be interchangeable decarbonization options, depending on the scale of substitution and corresponding marginal costs. As such, if one or more of the technologies is not deployed to the extent assumed in the modelling, Australia could still have the potential to decarbonize. The use of bioenergy for fuel switching in industry will necessitate increased feedstock collection, aggregation, processing and distribution to end-use locations, and a focus on supply chain development. If additional bioenergy is required there may be trade-offs in the allocation of land for feedstocks with other land use needs including agriculture, carbon forestry, and ecosystem services. This may limit the potential for further bioenergy fuel substitution in industry. For the illustrative pathway, 100% grid-supplied renewable energy electricity generation was modelled; two additional electricity generation technology mixes were modelled as variants to demonstrate contingency for any uncertainty about the viability of the 100% grid-supplied renewable energy electricity pathway. All three mixes result in a similar relative emissions intensity of electricity generation by 2050, well below the present intensity of 0.77 tCO2e/MWh, as summarized in Table 2. Emissions from all electricity generation technology mixes could be further reduced by the use of biogas in on-site and peak gas generation (provided further resources in biogas are secured). Table 2. Electricity generation variants modelled Generation mix in 2050 Emissions intensity of electricity in 2050 0.02 tCO2e/MWh Technology 100% renewables grid CCS included Nuclear included 96% renewables 4% gas (onsite) 65% renewables 7% coal CCS 14% gas CCS 14% gas 65% renewables 22% nuclear 13% gas 0.05 tCO2e/MWh 0.04 tCO2e/MWh The illustrative pathway does not model behavioral changes or step changes in technology, and only structural changes in response to domestic and global macroeconomic trends. However, deeper pathways could be achieved via the following: Behavior change 56  Smaller houses, greater range of tolerance in heating/cooling requirements (where feasible), less travel, more widespread availability and better public transport, increased proportion of less emissions-intensive products in shopping, decreased beef consumption.  Substitution of business travel with teleconferencing, preferential sourcing of less emissions- intensive products and services. Structural change  Urban design for shift to rail for passenger travel and freight transport.  Proactive and accelerated transition from emissions-intensive manufacturing and mining to more services. Step changes in technologies  Bioenergy potential in Australia is partially dependent on improvements in agricultural productivity, given agricultural residues are a large component of potential feedstocks. If agricultural productivity improves then the potential of bioenergy could increase. For example, based on the highest estimates of combined feedstock availability, an additional 1000 PJ of biomass could be used to replace gas and oil use in industry and transport, driving a further emissions reduction of nearly 30 MtCO2 in 2050 or 0.8 tCO2/capita. If CCS for small scale fuel combustion applications could be developed cost-effectively, it could be applied to reduce energy emissions from many of Australias energy-intensive sectors. For example, CCS applied to a third of all cement and non-ferrous metals production sites (excluding aluminum) could lead to a further reduction in industrial emissions of over 4 MtCO2in 2050 or 0.12 tCO2/capita.   Breakthroughs in fuel cell technology could lead to fuel cell vehicles penetrating the market sooner than modelled. For example, if half of the gas used for road freight was replaced by hydrogen by 2050, this could lead to a further reduction in transport emissions of 5.5 MtCO2, or 0.15 tCO2/capita.  The cost of renewable energy technologies has fallen faster than anticipated and further future breakthroughs could speed up decarbonization, offering greater decarbonization options. flexibility of  Breakthroughs in storage technology, particularly batteries, could see a more rapid adoption of electrification and distributed renewable energy generation.  Material efficiency (e.g. through 3D printing) could significantly reduce emissions by reducing the demand for minerals and base metals, depending on the life cycle emissions of materials required for manufacture. There are various technological, economic, social and political challenges implementing decarbonization pathways in Australia. However this report focuses on the technological challenges, which include: to  Demonstrating the viability of decarbonization technologies (e.g. CCS, energy storage, emerging renewables such as wave and enhanced geothermal systems, and rigorous carbon forestry accounting standards); 57  Developing the supply chains and workforce for new technologies and services (e.g. bioenergy, carbon forestry technologies and accounting methods). In a decarbonized world, Australias abundant renewable energy resources could form the basis of a new comparative advantage in low carbon energy generation, replacing the existing comparative advantage possessed through fossil fuels. Realizing this comparative advantage could result in a revival in energy-intensive manufacturing such as aluminum smelting, and the potential to develop renewable energy carriers for export markets, such as biogas or solar-thermal based energy carriers. The prerequisite for these co-benefits is that all major producing economies face strong carbon constraints, either through their domestic frameworks or through import demand favoring products from zero- carbon sources. Australia has the opportunity to be a global leader in CCS expertise and technology development thanks to its great potential for carbon capture and storage. Prospects for the extraction, refining and export of minerals such as non-ferrous metals and ores, uranium, lithium, and other precious metals may also be attractive. Australias substantial potential for bioenergy generation and bio-sequestration could contribute, for instance, to the economic revitalization of regional and rural communities, biodiversity protection, and improved water quality.14 land management practices, offer the opportunity to simultaneously address climate change, biodiversity, health, and social and cultural inclusion challenges.15 Other co-benefits include better air quality and improved health due to reduced fossil fuel use, increased production levels due to improved energy efficiency, and workforce productivity gains in more naturally lit and energy efficient workplaces. Indigenous-led carbon mitigation projects, applying traditional The fundamental enabler for the decarbonization of the Australian economy is the simultaneous decarbonization of all other major industrialized countries. For Australian industries to remain competitive in global markets, their competitors in other countries must also be exposed to the decarbonization pressures and drivers. This will also encourage public and private sector R&D efforts focused on low carbon technologies such as electrification, CCS and bioenergy. Australia faces the risk of locking in energy-intensive assets, especially for new vehicles, buildings, industrial plants, mines, and power stations. To ensure new technology developments can contribute effectively and efficiently to deep decarbonization, clear signals about Australias likely long-term emissions pathways are required to inform investment decisions. Government has a vital role to play in providing predictability of policy settings in order to minimize investment hold-ups and to reduce the risk of suboptimal investment decisions. 14 See for instance Eady, Grundy, Battaglia & Keating, 2009; Stucley et al., 2012. 15 Green & Minchin, 2012. 58 The development of decarbonization technologies and their costs is subject to steep and often unpredictable learning curves. A portfolio approach to R&D investment in technologies is required to maximize the chances of developing technologies that will achieve the deepest emissions reductions at the lowest costs. Long-term approaches for the development and deployment of these solutions will be required, and key areas for further investigation include:  R&D for renewable energy technologies, storage and grid-integration;  Planning for increased electrification of the economy, including the transport system;  CCS, including R&D and deployment of stand-alone industrial applications;   Continued energy efficiency improvement throughout the economy;  Applied research and on-ground experiments to determine tree species, soil types, and growing Investigation of options for zero-carbon energy industries; conditions that will maximize the potential for carbon forestry;  R&D on advanced bio-sequestration options and large-scale production of biofuels; and  Reducing food waste and the emissions attributable to the food production. Transition to a decarbonized world will require new forms of international collaboration, and a concerted approach to collaborative national knowledge creation and problem solving. 59 ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics).

Emissions would need to be transformed from 20.616 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita (tCO2e/cap) in 2010 to less than 2 tCO2e/cap in 2050. This represents a nearly 90% reduction in emissions from 2010 levels by 2050. The Canadian context presents a number of challenges related to achieving deep decarbonization:  First, national circumstances create structural to decarbonization. Challenges include Canadas vast land area (which drives substantial transportation demand), climate (which drives winter heating and summer cooling demand), and the importance of the resource extraction sector to the economy. impediments  Second, Canadas natural resource development aspirations are consistent with a global 2oC pathway only if deep decarbonization technologies are deployed. Global demand for fossil fuels and other primary resources is projected to rise even in deep decarbonization scenarios. As a result, the continued development of Canadas fossil fuel and mineral natural resources for global export can be consistent with a 2C pathway. However, this requires that transformative GHG mitigation technologies be deployed at every stage, including extraction, processing, and end-use.  Third, significant political, economic, and technical barriers to deep decarbonization need to be overcome, both in Canada and abroad. Technical constraints currently limit the availability of many options (such as hydrogen use for personal travel), and significant research, development, and deployment efforts will be needed both domestically and internationally. Cost and competitiveness outcomes are other challenges that must be overcome for technologies to be widely deployed (such as CCS). Finally, even options that meet both of these feasibility criteria may fail to be implemented due to public opposition and political pressures. The Canadian analysis presented in this chapter considers and incorporates these factors. However, in order to achieve the objective of the current phase of the DDPP processidentifying national technological pathways to deep decarbonizationthe analysis also looks beyond current political realities and envisions a hypothetical future in which Canada and other nations are aligned on the need 16 Excludes LULUCF emissions 61 to implement stringent policies to drive these changes and international competitiveness concerns associated with differential action are alleviated. Another important simplifying assumption in the analysis is that the Canadian emission reductions are achieved domestically, despite the fact that access to globally sourced GHG reduction opportunities will be politically and economically important to Canadas decarbonization effort. These assumptions are necessary in order to look beyond the status quo and investigate the transformative technological pathways that deep decarbonization in Canada will require. The insights gained from this analysis can then be used to inform policy discussions, as well as identify the implications of global decarbonization-driven technological shifts for Canadas economy. In 2010, total Canadian GHG emissions (including LULUCF) were 775.2 MtCO2e, equivalent to 22.8 tCO2e per capita (20.6 excluding LULUCF). As shown in Figure 1, emissions are dominated by the industrial and transportation sectors and driven by the use of fossil fuels, particularly refined petroleum products and natural gas. Note: Combustion CO2 emissions does not include upstream fugitive emissions (58 Mt in 2010). Between 1990 and 2010, energy-related emissions rose by 101 Mt CO2e, driven by population and economic growth (Figure 2a). Industrial output (particularly in the oil and gas sectors) has risen substantially, and the growing population and economy have spurred increasing transportation demand. These factors have been offset by improvements in energy efficiency: between 1990 and 2010 energy efficiency regulations drove an improvement of approximately 15% in the average fuel efficiency of the Canadian car fleet and approximately 25% in the heating energy intensity of new residential buildings. 62 While the overall carbon intensity of energy use did not change significantly between 1990 and 2010, Canadian electricity production has started shifting toward lower and zero emission sources. The Canadian federal government recently imposed regulations effectively requiring all new and retrofitted electricity generation to have the GHG intensity of a natural gas combined cycle gas turbine or better. Each province also has carbon regulations in place that drive electricity decarbonization, such as feed- in-tariffs and a coal-fired power ban in Ontario, a flexible levy on marginal industrial emissions in Alberta, a renewable portfolio standard in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and a net zero GHG standard for new generation in British Columbia. The Canadian deep decarbonization pathway examines the major shifts in technology adoption, energy use, and economic structure that are consistent with continued growth in the population and economy and a nearly 90% reduction in GHG emissions from 2010 levels by 2050. It is important to remember that this pathway is not a forecast, but rather an illustrative scenario designed to identify technology- related needs, challenges, uncertainties, and opportunities. The analysis is based on a set of global and domestic assumptions about key emissions drivers, technology availability, and economic activity. In order to reveal the technological pathways to deep decarbonization in Canada, current political realities were suspended, and important assumptions were made related to demand for Canadian oil and gas exports, commercial availability of transformative technologies, the availability of globally sourced GHG reductions, and the extent to which global decarbonization creates new export opportunities for Canadian goods and services. These assumptions are discussed at the end of this section. A technology-specific energy-economy model (CIMS) was then used to simulate the energy-using technology pathways that firms and individuals would follow under the DDPP scenario. The results provide insight into the key areas where decarbonization will occur, as well as where deep emission reductions will be challenging to achieve. 63 The Canadian deep decarbonization pathway achieves an overall GHG emission reduction of nearly 90% (651 MtCO2e) from 2010 levels by 2050, while maintaining strong economic growth (see Table 1).17 Over this period, GDP rises from $1.26 trillion to $3.81 trillion (real $2010 USD), a tripling of Canadas economy. Table 1. Development Indicators and Energy Service Demand Drivers Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/capita, 2010 price] 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 33.7 37.6 41.4 44.8 48.3 37,288 49,787 57,754 67,500 78,882 The reduction in emissions is driven most significantly by a dramatic reduction in the carbon intensity of energy use, as renewables and biomass become the dominant energy sources, and there is broad fuel switching across the economy toward electricity and biofuels (Figure 3 and Figure4a). Electricity production nearly completely decarbonizes (Figure 4b). Overall, the carbon intensity of Canadas total primary energy supply declines by 90% between 2010 and 2050. This result is resilient to several technology scenarios. If biofuels are not viable the transport stock could transition to increased use of electricity generated with renewables and fossil fuels with CCS, especially if better batteries become available. If CCS is not available, the electricity sector could decarbonize using more renewables and/or nuclear, and vice versa. 17 Net LULUCF emissions are omitted in the DDPP process. 64 The other major driver of emission reductions is the dramatic reduction in the energy intensity of the economy between 2010 and 2050, as shown in Figure4a and Pillar 1 of Figure 4b. End-use energy consumption rises by only 17% over this period, compared to a 203% increase in GDP. This is due to both structural changes in the economy and energy efficiency. The economy diversifies away from the industrial sector to some extent, and within the industrial sector, output from the refining, cement, and lime sectors falls compared to the reference case scenario, while output from the electricity, biodiesel, and ethanol sectors rises. Output from the oil and gas sector falls slightly from the reference case, but it still doubles. In combination, these factors drive a nearly complete decarbonization of the buildings, transportation, and electricity sectors. As shown in Figure 5, by 2050 Canadas remaining emissions in the deep decarbonization scenario come primarily from industry. Two of the core foundations of the Canadian deep decarbonization pathwaynearly complete decarbonization of the buildings and transportation sectorsare well understood, with significant progress already achieved. Other elements of the pathway are less certain and more susceptible to global factors, including global demand (and hence emissions) from the heavy industrial and energy extraction and processing sectors and the availability of transformative GHG abatement technologies. To address these uncertainties, the Canadian analysis is based on four key characteristics: 1) International demand for crude oil and natural gas remains substantial under a deep decarbonization scenario. As a result, oil and gas production (as well as the end use of fossil fuels) substantially decarbonize by 2050, and the sector is able to remain a thriving contributor to the national economy. This assumption is discussed further in Technical Options and Assumptions for National Deep Decarbonization. 2) The analysis assumes that all emission reductions are achieved domestically, despite the importance of lower-cost global reductions to achieving decarbonization in Canada. This assumption is being made by all country teams, since the DDPP process is focused on 65 identifying the decarbonization pathways and technical changes that are likely to drive deep emission reductions in each country. However, in practice, international cooperation to maximize the efficiency of worldwide emission reduction efforts will be critical. 3) Global demand patterns for Canadian goods and services do not change. Depending on the decarbonization pathways followed by other countries, demand for various Canadian goods and services could increase, potentially including biomass (as cellulosic ethanol or biodiesel), primary metals (iron, nickel, zinc, rare earths, and uranium), fertilizers (both from mined potash and nitrogen/ammonia-based sources derived from natural gas), and/or energy efficiency technologies (particularly in the vehicle sector). However, the scope and scale of this impact is highly uncertain. These dynamics will be explored in future phases of the DDPP. 4) There will be significant domestic innovation and global spillovers in transformative low- carbon technologies, leading to the commercial viability of next-generation cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel, as well as CCS in the electricity generation, natural gas processing, hydrogen production, and industrial sectors. These assumptions are discussed further in Technical Options and Assumptions for National Deep Decarbonization. 2.1.2. In the deep decarbonization scenario, the Canadian energy supply is transformed between 2010 and 2050. Over this period, consumption of electricity rises nearly 70%, from 505 to 1,354 TWh, while the sectors total emissions fall by 95%, from 101 to 5 MtCO2. As shown in Figure 6, this is led by an increase in the share of renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar, and biomass) in the generation mix and supported by the use of CCS to decarbonize coal and natural gas-fuelled generation. Nuclear output was assumed to remain constant, due to facility siting and political challenges. 66 Oil and natural gas consumption decline, while biofuels become the core liquid fuel, and hydrogen enters the energy mix (Figure 6b). Sufficient access to the feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel was assumed; however, the electricity generation mix does not include net sequestration of biomass, given insufficient information regarding the availability of sufficient sustainable feedstock. Due to these fuel supply shifts, by 2050 the electricity, transportation, and building sectors have almost completely decarbonized, and the Canadian emissions profile is dominated by a subset of industrial emissions that are very difficult and expensive to reduce (Table ). The following sections highlight the key changes that drive emission reductions in each of these sectors. 67 Table 2: Remaining GHG Emissions in 2050 by Sector (% of Total) Sector % of Total Electricity Transportation Buildings Industry Agriculture 5.9% 5.9% 3.5% 74.9% 11.1% Note: Total exceeds 100% due to rounding. Overall transportation sector emissions fall by 97% between 2010 and 2050, from 198 to 5 MtCO2. In the personal and freight transportation sectors, this decarbonization is initially driven by vehicle efficiency improvements and then by substantial fuel switching to biofuels (predominantly cellulosic ethanol for personal transport and biodiesel for freight transport), electricity, and hydrogen (Figure 7c). Note: Carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. 68 Energy efficiency regulations have already led to substantial GHG reductions in the transportation sector, and new vehicle stock is on track to almost completely decarbonize by the late 2030s or early 2040s if regulatory goals continue to strengthen at their recent rate. Passenger kilometers travelled remain fairly constant, while freight movement per dollar of GDP falls by 35% between 2010 and 2050, as the economy becomes less dependent on the movement of freight. Structurally, there is a slight mode shift from personal vehicles to mass transportation (transit, bus, and rail), while in the freight transportation sector, the use of heavy trucks declines substantially, primarily in favor of rail. Overall building sector emissions fall by 96% between 2010 and 2050, from 69 to 3 MtCO2. The bulk of the emission reductions are the result of fuel switching, with natural gas use virtually eliminated and electricity providing nearly all of the sectors energy by 2050 (Figure 7b). Air and ground source heat pumps are the primary energy supply technologies in use, with some peaking with baseboard electric heat. Per capita residential floor area remains fairly constant, while the commercial sector becomes more space efficient, and commercial floor area per dollar of GDP falls by 36%. Building energy efficiency has already improved substantially, and forthcoming energy efficiency regulations will continue to drive reductions in space heating energy use, keeping the sector on a trajectory toward nearly complete decarbonization. Industrial emissions fall by 80% between 2010 and 2050, from 313 to 64 MtCO2e. The structure of the industrial sector shifts, with output from the refining and cement and lime sectors falling compared to the reference case and output from the electricity, ethanol, and biodiesel sectors rising. While slightly lower than in the reference case, output from the oil and gas sector still doubles. The vast majority of the industrial sectors emissions reductions are a result of fuel switching (particularly to electricity) and the widespread adoption of CCS to reduce chemical by-product and process heat related emissions (Figure 7a). Process emission controls are also put in place for the cement and lime, chemical production, iron and steel, and oil and gas extraction sectors. While not the focus of the DDPP at this stage, this study included an analysis of strategies to reduce agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions, and the Canadian decarbonization pathway includes an 83% reduction in these emissions between 2010 and 2050 (from 55 to 9.5 MtCO2e). These reductions result from efforts to reduce atmospheric emissions due to enteric fermentation, manure management, and agricultural soils, and include measures such as methane capture, controlled anaerobic digestion and flaring or generation, and no-till agricultural practices. The Canadian decarbonization pathway is dominated by four major dynamics, providing insight into the key areas where Canada can take action to decarbonize:  Reinforced and deepened energy efficiency improvement trends in all energy end-uses; 69  Eventual decarbonization of the electricity sector;  Fuel switching to lower carbon fuels and decarbonized energy carriers (e.g. electricity, transport biofuels and hydrogen); and  Direct GHG reduction for industrial processes and thermal heat generation (e.g. via carbon capture and storage and process changes). This section discusses each of these decarbonization opportunities and the key assumptions and uncertainties involved. End-use energy efficiency improvements are a key decarbonization pathway in Canada, particularly in the transportation and buildings sectors. Energy efficiency roughly doubles in both sectors by 2050, which is consistent with the trajectory already established by existing and forthcoming efficiency regulations. Decarbonizing electricity production is essential, since it is a precondition to reducing emissions throughout the rest of the economy through electrification. To decarbonize Canadas electricity generation stock, investment in a wide range of low-emitting electric generation technologies will need to more than double from baseline levels in the deep decarbonization scenario. Our modelling assumes that the cost and capacity factors of wind and solar improve to a degree that allows 17% of generation to come from wind and 10% from solar PV. Both require restructuring of electricity markets and transmission grids to allow for and encourage high intermittent renewable content. In addition to intermittent renewables, significant deployment of CCS will be required to facilitate large- scale switching to decarbonized electricity. The analysis assumes that post-combustion CCS will be commercially viable for the electricity sector by 2020 and that eventually solid oxide fuel cells (which provide a virtually pure CO2 waste stream) or a technology of equivalent GHG intensity will be used to achieve approximately 99% CO2 capture. The Canadian decarbonization pathway includes significant fuel switching to decarbonized energy carriers, with the transportation, industrial, and residential/commercial sectors switching to electricity, hydrogen, and advanced biofuels. Fuel switching in the transportation sector will require further developments in batteries (less so for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles) and hydrogen storage. Fuel switching to advanced biofuels will also depend on the development of a decarbonized fuel source with adequate feedstocks (e.g. cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel based on woody biomass or algae) and significant technological innovation to make these fuels commercially available. To achieve significant decarbonization, a cost-effective method of reducing chemical by-product (e.g. from natural gas processing and hydrogen, cement, lime, and steel production) and process heat- related emissions is essential. This will require the deployment of CCS in these sectors, along with other transformative technologies that are not yet commercially available (e.g. down-hole oxy-combustion or 70 in-situ electrothermal extraction in the petroleum extraction sector and switching from pyro to hydro metallurgy in metal smelting). As mentioned previously, the Canadian deep decarbonization pathway assumes that international demand for crude oil and natural gas remains substantial. If international oil prices remain above the cost of production, continued growth of the Canadian oil sands sector (with decarbonization measures) can be consistent with deep emission reduction efforts and would support continued economic development. The literature conflicts on whether production from the oil sands can be cost-effective in a deep decarbonization scenario; the answer depends on policy, the cost of reducing production emissions, and assumptions regarding transport energy use and efficiency. However, the International Energy Agencys World Energy Outlook 2013 indicates that even in a 450 ppm world, oil sands production could remain at levels similar to today or higher.18 Several elements of the Canadian decarbonization pathways are well understood and are expected to provide an essential foundation for deep decarbonization under all pathways, such as energy efficiency improvements in the buildings and transportation sectors. Other elements depend on technological innovation and stronger climate policy signals, and their future contribution to Canadian emissions reductions is more uncertain. The commercial availability of CCS falls into this latter category, since the technology is not commercially viable with current climate policy stringency. If CCS does not achieve commercial viability in the electricity production sector or is blocked due to public acceptability concerns, alternative decarbonization pathways could be based on increased generation from either nuclear power or renewables. The Canadian decarbonization pathway assumes that nuclear generation is limited to current installed capacity, due to the challenges associated with siting new facilities. However, if public acceptance and siting challenges were overcome, this constraint could be relaxed. Renewables such as solar and wind power are already projected to play a major role in electricity generation by 2050. They have the theoretical potential to expand further, but their intermittency is a limiting factor, and further expansion would depend on development of a North American-wide high voltage direct current transmission grid to balance renewable supply and demand or significant breakthroughs in storage technologies. The analysis also assumes substantial deployment of CCS to address process heat emissions in natural gas processing, hydrogen production, and industrial sectors. If this does not occur, the key alternative is direct electrification of industrial processes, such as substituting hydro metallurgy for pyro metallurgy. The Canadian decarbonization pathway also includes significant fuel switching to cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel in the transportation sector, which relies on the assumption that these fuels will be commercially viable. However, the transportation sector has more flexibility than many other sectors, since biofuels, electricity, and hydrogen all contribute to the sectors emission reductions. If biofuels are 18 International Energy Agency (IEA). 2013. World Energy Outlook 2013. www.worldenergyoutlook.org 71 not available, alternative decarbonization pathways could be based on greater electrification of transportation or more aggressive fuel switching to hydrogen (although there are currently technical issues with practical hydrogen storage in personal vehicles, and there is currently no hydrogen supply network). The Canadian decarbonization pathway was developed by using a technology-rich stock turnover simulation model, which includes and evaluates both currently available technologies and those still under development but with the potential for future commercial availability. The Canadian pathway is extremely aggressive and ambitious, reducing emissions by nearly 90% between 2010 and 2050. As a result, few additional measures and deeper pathways are available. One emission reduction option that is currently being investigated in Canada is accelerated weathering of mine wastes. Some mine tailings mineralize atmospheric carbon dioxide, and researchers are working on accelerating this process, both abiotically and microbially. This could offset the GHG emissions from mining projects and has the theoretical potential to sequester much larger quantities of emissions, turning mine wastes into a significant carbon sinks.19 Another known decarbonization pathway not included in this version of the analysis is the full suite of potential options for switching from pyro metallurgy (using heat) to hydro metallurgy (using acid solutions and electricity) in the metal smelting sectors. Finally, another pathway that may allow deeper reductions is the use of biomass with CCS in electricity generation to create net sequestration electricity production; we have not considered this option due to potential feedstock limitation issues. The fossil fuel production and mineral extraction sectors play a major role in the Canadian economy. However, their export-oriented nature is a challenge, since they create significant production emissions in Canada even though the outputs are consumed in other countries. The commercial availability of CCS will be essential to economically address these emissions. More broadly, many of the major changes described in the Canadian decarbonization pathway will not occur without strong policy signals, which will require public support and in many cases will be driven by public pressure, whether domestically or indirectly through external market-access pressures. Technological innovation and deployment is a critical component of the Canadian pathway, but large- scale deployment of new technologies is dependent on public acceptance, which must be earned through continued engagement and dialogue and cannot be assumed. A significant knowledge gap in the Canadian decarbonization pathway is how global decarbonization efforts will change demand for products and services that support low-carbon development and in which Canada has a competitive advantage. Changing global demand patterns could lead to the expansion of existing industries or the development of new industries, dampening adverse decarbonization impacts and supporting continued economic development. 19 Dipple, G. et al. 2012. Carbon Mineralization in Mine Waste. Available online at http://www.cmc-nce.ca/wp- content/uploads/2012/06/Greg-Dipple.pdf 72 International cooperation is required to support research, development, and deployment of critical decarbonization technologies, as well as to implement a global equimarginal abatement effort through GHG reduction sales and purchases. Technical constraints make the marginal cost of emissions abatement based on currently available technologies very high in the heavy industrial and energy extraction and processing sectors, compared to other Canadian decarbonization options and to the cost of reducing emissions in many other countries. A focus on global (rather than purely national) emission reductions is the most efficient way to address this challenge. While the current phase of the DDPP project focused on identifying national technological pathways, this topic will be key in the next phase of the DDPPs work. The Canadian deep decarbonization scenario depends on significant technological innovation and deployment. This requires both domestic investment and innovation and global research cooperation and technology spillovers. To remain on the path toward deep decarbonization, increased investment and accelerated research, development, and deployment efforts will be required in the following priority areas:  Improving post-combustion CCS, for both electricity generation and industrial process applications;  Development and commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells and other technologies, including pre-combustion capture, that either reduce GHG intensity or reduce the cost of CCS by producing a pure CO2 waste stream;  Enhanced transmission grid flexibility and energy storage technologies to allow more electricity generation from intermittent renewables;  Development and commercialization of cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuels derived from woody biomass, algae or other feedstocks; and  Development and commercialization of batteries and hydrogen storage to enable electrification and fuel switching to hydrogen in the transportation sector. In parallel with efforts to collaborate on the deployment of critical enabling technologies, addressing the significant differential in abatement opportunities and marginal abatement costs across countries and sectors must be an international priority. While challenging to implement, a global equimarginal abatement effort through GHG reduction sales and purchases has the potential to be the most efficient way to achieve the global target while maintaining strong economic growth. 73 Despite fast growth over the last decade (with an average GDP growth rate of 10% over 2000-2012), China is still a developing country with a low level of economic development. In 2010, its GDP was 5,930 billion US$, and per capita GDP was just 4,433 US$. Chinas has a very significant secondary sector of the economy, which contributed 48.3% to GDP in 2013, but this sectors contribution has declined by 12.5 percentage points since 2000, while the tertiary sector of the economy increased by 12 percentage points. Due to economic and social development, Chinas level of urbanization has risen from 26.4% in 1990 to 53.7% in 2013. With a 1% increase in urbanization rate, 13 million Chinese inhabitants move to cities every year to pursue a higher standard of living. China is also the most populous country in the world; by the end of 2013, Chinas population was 1.36 billion, about 20% of the world total. Although China has made remarkable progress, it is under heavy pressure to improve environmental protection due its resource-intensive development. Xi Jinping, Chinas President, has described the countrys recent model of economic development as unsustainable, not least because pollution is harming lives and livelihoods, particularly in cities. China recognizes the problems created by pollution, both from greenhouse gases (GHGs) that cause climate change and from other gases and particles. China is also facing growing constraints due to the limited availability of natural resources other than coal. Chinas leadership has signaled its intention to accelerate the transformation of Chinas growth model, to make China an innovative country, and to promote more efficient, equal and, sustainable economic development. According to Second National Communication on Climate Change in 2005, Chinas total GHG emissions were approximately 7.5 Gt CO2eq of which carbon dioxide accounted for 80%, methane for 13%, nitrous oxide for 5%, and fluorinated gases for 2%. The total net GHG removals through land use change and forestry was about 421 Mt CO2 eq. Of total GHG emissions, energy activities represent 77% in 2010 (7.2 GtCO2) with direct emissions from electricity, industry, transportation, and buildings at 2,929 MtCO2, 2,999 MtCO2, 634 MtCO2, and 633 74 MtCO2 respectively (Figure 1a). The major emitting energy activities are the coal-intensive power generation and industrial sectors (Figure 1b). Notably, as the main sector driving economic growth, the industry sector accounts for 68% of total nal energy consumption and almost 71% of total energy- related CO2 emissions in 2010. This is essentially from a few energy-intensive industries, which consume about 50% of energy use in the industry sector (iron and steel, cement, synthesis ammonia, and ethylene production). Source: Second National Communication on Climate Change (2005) The growth of Chinas economy has been the major driver of increasing emissions in the past three decades. The structure of this growth has had opposite dynamics over the last decades with direct consequences on emissions. During the first ten years of Chinas openness policies (1980-1990), structural change favored lower-emission activities and helped to decouple emissions from aggregate growth. This was followed by a rapid process of industrialization, which saw a double digit growth rate in the heavy industries. This industrialization accelerated growth in emissions faster than GDP, though this was tempered in the 11th Five-Year Plan. This shows the crucial impact of economic structure on Chinas future emission rates. Coal has dominated Chinas energy mix over the past decades, supporting economic growth with a high carbon intensity fuel. The only factor that has significantly contributed to slow the rate of growth in emissions has been energy efficiency, as seen in the reduction of Chinas energy intensity per unit of GDP (Figure 2a). Electricity generation has been the major driver of the increase in carbon emissions, since the growing needs for electricity have been satisfied by the fast development of coal-based power units. 75 Although China is now the country with the highest emission levels, current and historical per capita emissions are still lower than IPCC Annex I country levels, whether on an annual (5.4tCO2e/cap) or cumulative (95 tCO2e/cap over 1850-2009) basis. Given these recent trends, continuously increasing emissions can be expected in the future with business as usual economic growth. The illustrative deep decarbonization pathway combines an acceleration of the evolution of economic structure, reductions in energy intensity and the promotion of non-fossil fuel energy to control emissions in a context of continued economic growth. GDP per capita is assumed to increase by more than 6 times from 2010 to 2050 to satisfy development needs, but energy trends are significantly decoupled from this growth with an increase of primary and final energy of 78% (from 93.7 EJ in 2010 to 166.9 EJ in 2050) and 71% (from 66.9 EJ in 2010 to 114.4 EJ in 2050) respectively (Figure 3). This increase is mainly triggered by the industrial sector (+28%), buildings sector (+141%), and transportation sector (+204%), along with changes in economic structure, an increase in urbanization rate, and the completion of the industrialization process. In particular, the share of coal in primary energy consumption falls to 20% in 2050, while the use of natural gas and non-fossil fuels increase, contributing 17% and 43% respectively. Table 1. The development indicators and energy service demand drivers in China Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/capita, 2010 price] 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 1360 4455 1433 1453 1435 1385 8708 14666 20945 27789 76 In the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway, energy-related CO2 emissions decrease by 34%, from 7.25 GtCO2 in 2010 to 4.77 GtCO2 in 2050, essentially due to a decrease of both the primary energy per unit of GDP by 73% and of energy-related CO2 emissions per unit of energy by 61% (Figure 4a). The former is largely explained by structural change with a large decrease of the share of energy-intensive sectors of the economy and improvement of economy-wide energy efficiency. The latter mainly comes from decarbonizing the power sector and the electrification of end-uses (from 21% in 2010 to 32% 2050) while increasing living standards and modernizing energy use patterns (Figure 4b). The application of CCS technologies in power generation and the industrial sector is also a crucial feature of this illustrative pathway, contributing 1.3 GtCO2 and 0.8 GtCO2 respectively. At the sectoral level, the industry sector emissions remain the largest, but buildings and transportation increase in share, from 17% in 2010 to 49% of 2050 emissions (Figure 5). 77 Electrification is an important indicator of economic and social development, and electricity consumption in the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario is projected to reach 10,143 TWh in 2050, or 7,300 kWh per capita (around 2.5 times the 2010 level). Since thermal power, especially from coal, is an important source of local pollutants and GHGs, the decarbonization of power sector is of significance for the achievement of low-carbon development. The carbon emission intensity of power generation in 2050 will decrease from 743 gCO2/kwh in 2010 to 32 gCO2/kwh in 2050 (Figure 6a). This is permitted by the large-scale use of nuclear (which reaches 25% of electricity production in 2050), intermittent renewables (installed capacity of wind and solar respectively equal 900 GW and 1,000 GW in 2050, contributing 18% and 17% of electricity generation respectively), and hydro (which accounts for an additional 18%). Fossil-fuel power generation units still represent 24% of electricity generation in 2050 (notably because natural gas power generation technologies act as an important back-up technology for intermittent generation technologies). Fossil-based emissions are reduced by a large percentage due to the deployment of efficient technology options (notably, all new coal power plants after 2020 will be supercritical, ultra- supercritical, or IGCC power generation technologies) and CCS facilities on 90% of coal power plants and 80% of natural gas power plants. This diffusion supposes that CCS technology will become commercialized after 2030. 78 Energy efficiency could be improved by a large degree through technological innovation in industrial sectors20. This would permit a reduction of energy consumption per value added of the industry sector by 74% from 2010 to 2050, limiting the rise of final energy consumption to 28% (from 46 EJ in 2010 to 58 EJ in 2050). By promoting the transformation of coal-fired boilers to gas-fired boilers and enhancing the use of electricity, the illustrative pathway reduces the share of coal from 56% in 2010 to 30% in 2050, while increasing that of gas and electricity in final energy use. Since its hard to change feed composition in some industries, it is not expected that further significant changes in energy structure are possible. In addition, structural changes in industry could be achieved through developing strategic industries, controlling overcapacity of main industry outputs, and eliminating backward production capacity. Notably, many high-energy-intensive industry sectors will experience a slower growth, and the output of some high-energy-intensive industry products (notably, cement and crude steel) are anticipated peak by 2020. 20 E.g., replacing converter with electric furnace or using waste heat of low temperature flue gas in sintering and pelletizing in iron and steel industry and replacing vertical shaft kilns with new dry production process and enforcing low-temperature cogeneration in cement industry. 79 These different options lead a 57% decrease of CO2 emissions in the industry sector, particularly due to the contribution of CCS technology. If CCS is deployed appropriately on a commercialized scale after 2030 in key industry sectors, it is expected to sequester 28% of total CO2 emissions in the industry sector in 2050 (Figure 7a). Total floor area will continue to grow (from 45.2 billion m2 in 2010 to 80.3 billion m2 in 2050), and the urban and rural residential building floor areas per capita will increase (reaching around 36 m2 and 47 m2 respectively) in parallel with the process of urbanization. This pushes total energy consumption up by 140% (from 11 EJ to 27 EJ) in line with a 33% increase of energy consumption per capita. Energy efficiency measures play an important role in limiting this rise of energy demand, where performance improves by 25%, 22% and 10% from 2010 to 2050 for commercial, urban residential and rural residential units respectively and appliance energy efficiency increases (e.g. 66% and 75% for regular and central air conditioners). The proportion of coal in energy use decreases gradually (from 39% in 2010 to 5% in 2050), as electricity and gas rise (reaching 50.5% and 33.2% in 2050 respectively). This triggers a decrease of the average carbon emission intensity from 119.8 gCO2/MJ in 2010 to 32.7 gCO2/MJ in 2050. That ensures a 34% lower emissions level in 2050 compared to 2010 (Figure 7b). Pushed by rising mobility demand along with wealth increase (a ten-fold increase of kilometers per capita to reach 20,000 km/cap in 2050), energy consumption in transport will almost triple, from 9.3 EJ in 2010 to 28.1 EJ in 2050, representing a rising share of total energy consumption, from 14% in 2010 to 24% in 2050. A partial decoupling will allow the carbon emissions to rise by only 149% (from 652 MtCO2 in 2010 to 1,621 MtCO2 in 2050) due to transport mode shifts, an increase of vehicle fuel economy, and the promotion of electricity and biofuel use (Figure 7c). The primary mode shift encompasses a transition from on-road to off-road modes of transport, where rail and water transport grow over time. In freight transportation, road transportation is limited to 32% in 2050, water transportation maintains the highest share (about 42% in 2050) and railway grows to 24%. Within the passenger transportation, road transportation will be kept at 35% in 2050 and railway transportation will remain the main transportation mode (45% of total passenger mobility in 2050) notably due to the development of high-speed railway and rail-based transit systems in cities (attaining 50,000 km by 2050, 36 times higher than in 2010). For the on-road transportation, improvement of transportation management is an important option to control the rapid growth of demand. An increase in fuel economy is also crucial, with a 70% improvement of light duty vehicles energy intensity and the deployment of high efficiency diesel vehicles in freight transportation. And, even more importantly, the share of gasoline and diesel vehicles sold significantly decreases by 2050 because of the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles. In intra-city transportation low-carbon vehicles gradually play a more dominant role with the adoption of pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), biofuels and fuel-cell vehicles (FCV). A reduction in gasoline and diesel use also occurs because of railway electrification, which will play a dominant role in the railway energy mix by 2050. 80 Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes both direct end-use emissions and indirect emissions related to electricity production. Emphasizing technology development and innovation is vital for the achievement of the Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway. Sufficient input on technology R&D and incentives for technology deployment are necessary. In order to achieve the decarbonization pathway, significant technological and economic effort needs to be made in different sectors, and low-carbon technologies must be distributed across the country. The most important low-carbon options, especially energy saving technologies in end use sectors, in the illustrative pathway are discussed below:  Transport: high-efficiency diesel vehicle or gasoline cars, electricity vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles in passenger transport; a 30% improvement of fuel economy for conventional high duty vehicles; fully electrified rail-based transit for both long-distance and short-distance by 2050.  Buildings: increasing energy efficiency for both existing and new buildings through innovative technologies (like advanced, low-carbon buildings, which will increase their share in urban regions from 2% in 2012 to 50% in 2020 and help to reduce the heating and cooling demand); to substitute for coal boilers, the application of advanced heating facilities, such as ground source heat pumps and decentralized solar heating systems as well as natural gas boilers and CHP for centralized heating; development of high-energy-efficiency cooling systems, lighting system and appliances; the large-scale use of renewable energy, such as solar water heaters in residential buildings. Industry: high-efficiency waste heat recycling technologies, high efficiency boilers and motors across all sectors; energy saving technologies in high-energy-intensive industries permitting a  81 fall from 2010 to 2050 of the energy consumption per unit of product output of crude steel, cement, ammonia and ethylene by 48%, 32%, 26%, and 26%, respectively.  Electricity generation: an increased reliance on non-fossil fuel power generation technologies is the major contributor to the reduction in the carbon intensity of electricity generation. Hydro power production of 500 GW approaches its potential by 2050; wind power reaches 1,000 GW in 2050 (70% off-shore); solar energy power generation experiences a fast development, where solar PV and solar thermal reach approximately 1,000GW and 150GW respectively in 2050; biomass-fired power generation and other renewables will be limited due to resource constraints and high relative cost; nuclear power generation technologies will be developed (due to learning from foreign advanced technologies and domestic research and demonstration) and exceed 300GW by 2050.  CCS technologies will be another important technology and will be deployed in both the power and industry sectors at scale in 2050. It is expected that CCS is developed and demonstrated from 2020 and deployed at a commercialized scale from 2030. Both CO2 utilization and geologic storage have great potential compared to the amount of CO2 captured in the illustrative pathway (0.1 to 1 billion ton per year for the former, more than 1 billion ton annually for the latter). In order to achieve the illustrative decarbonization pathway, there are key measures that must deviate significantly from current trends. This includes a low-carbon transition in electricity generation even as electricity demand increases faster than gains in end-use energy efficiency. The former dimension depends on the development and deployment of non-fossil fuel power generation; the improvement in energy efficiency concerns key industrial sectors, vehicles, urban buildings, and residential appliances. There are still uncertainties with some key measures and technologies that might affect the achievement of this pathway, such as the integration of intermittent renewable power into the power system, application of CCS facilities, supply of natural gases, and penetration of electric vehicles. In case the magnitude of the measures discussed above is less than assumed, some alternative approaches could be envisioned, leading to different emissions scenarios. For example, the proportion of non-fossil fuel electricity is 41% in 2050 in the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway, of which nuclear power represents a share of 31%. However, if the nuclear development is hindered in the future, coal power (with CCS) or renewable power might grow in its place. Increase reliance on wind and solar energy in the power sector is possible, though it largely depends on the possibility of developing new energy storage solutions or enough natural gas power units to manage the resource intermittency. A large portion of Chinas emissions are linked to the process of urbanization since large quantities of construction materials will be required to build and maintain urban infrastructure, especially cement and steel. Measures to decrease the demolition of buildings and transportation infrastructures will contribute to further deeper decarbonization by combining a reduction of material consumption intensity and reuse of waste construction materials. 82 The early deployment of key mitigation technologies can help China follow a deeper decarbonization pathway that will also contribute to the growth of Chinas economy in other ways. Notably, the large scale of the Chinese market, production economies of scale, and learning-by-doing can help accelerate cost reductions and diffusion of low-carbon energy options, in line with Chinas development strategy to grow strategic emerging industries. Chinas growth has been characterized by a high saving and investment rate in the past three decades. In the future, China will maintain its growth rate around 7%, reduce its saving and investment rate, and increase the share of consumption in its GDP. To maintain the growth rate at a relatively high level while reducing the investment rate, China needs to increase the productivity of its investment. Deep decarbonization strategies can contribute to this gain in productivity through: 1) shifting the structure of the economy towards less capital intensive sectors (e.g. from industrial sectors to service sectors); 2) improving the efficiency of capital investment to produce output, especially through energy saving; and 3) increase the productivity of other factors, especially labor and energy. China's future development is the source of much uncertainty when examining potential emission reduction pathways. First, the level of economic growth is largely uncertain. The average Chinese growth rate has been a little more than 10% in the past twenty years. The 18th CPC National Congress has projected that the GDP growth rate will be around 7.2% in the next decade. This reduction of 3 to 4 percentage points is more than the typical growth rate of developed countries. China's economy will continue to develop at a relatively high speed, varying from 5% to 10%. This expected variation will have a significant impact on the actual level of energy demand. The second aspect is future adjustments to industrial structure and changes in the mode of development. Chinas energy consumption per unit of GDP is twice the average level of the world, which means there is a significant opportunity for reductions in energy intensity. However, the decline cannot depend on incremental technology change, because Chinas power plants are newly-built with efficient supercritical and ultra-supercritical units, and for energy-intensive industries the efficiency gap compared to developed countries is low (10%-20%).Therefore, the focal point in China is to adjust the industrial structure and change the mode of development towards less heavy and chemical industry as well as less production of energy-consuming products like steel and cement. Nevertheless, the issues of how to adjust and how to identify the degree and intensity of the adjustment have great uncertainties. The third aspect is urbanization, triggered by the demand of social development. The demand for steel and cement is very large in the process of urbanization. According to estimates, there may be an increase of 1 percentage point in the urbanization rate each year. Finally, exports are an important factor in the economy, production of which significantly contributes to total emissions. Currently, 25% of energy is used for the production of export products in China, and given that adjustments of the structure of exports is not an easy task, manufacturing exports (and 83 associated emissions) are expected to remain important in the long run. This area of potential emission reductions would benefit from further investigation. The reduction of CO2 emissions is not only a response to climate change, but it also addresses the urgent demand of developing the national economy. If the coordination works well, the strategy of climate change mitigation and sustainable development will lead to a win-win situation. The guiding ideology and the concept of development must be changed among all cadres. The central government should understand the trade-off between GDP growth highly dependent on resource industry and the cost paid for resources losses. The central and western regions need to be redesigned and readjusted so as to draw more attention to climate change. At the same time, the evaluation mechanism of officials must be revised. The promotion of a position should not only rely on the growth rate of GDP but should also look at a comprehensive analysis of gain and loss. The reform of the energy sector needs to be promoted, including the reform of the price system and fiscal taxation system. Although China's energy price remains high in developing countries, the price structure and pricing system is very reasonable, especially that of coal and electricity. The current price of coal and electricity does not include the environmental cost, and so the exploitation of resources does great damage to the environment. The reform of resource taxes and the proposal of a carbon tax must be considered in energy policy, along with the price system and fiscal and financial field. China has established 7 pilot emissions trading schemes (ETSs) at provincial and city levels with a view to establish a national ETS around 2020. The future development of Chinas ETS should build upon the experience gained in regional pilots and resemble the approach taken in the EU ETS and the Australian and Californian schemes. A careful design is key for the success of Chinas ETS, especially in the electricity sector, as is practical and reliable company-level measurements, reporting, and verification of emissions. An early stage of harmonization with design of other international ETSs will facilitate the linkage with these ETSs in the future. Methods for reducing the use of coal have many synergistic effects. The main way to improve the domestic environment is to reduce coal mining. Substantial coal mining not only consumes a large amount of water, but it also leads to slag penetration and deposition, resulting in the serious pollution of groundwater resources. In addition, coal mining causes the collapse of areas that have been mined. The area of subsidence in China has reached 10,000 km2. Furthermore, conventional pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and dust (including the thick fog and haze weather in Beijing and Tianjin) are partly caused by burning coal. Therefore, the reduction of coal consumption is essential for China to improve domestic environmental quality. 84 France has a low endowment of domestic fossil resources (domestic production represents less than 2% of primary consumption) and energy imports, mostly oil and gas, are a substantial source of total external trade deficit (these imports represent around 70 billion US$ (2012), a deficit close to the total external trade deficit in 2012). Faced with this situation, France has developed a specific energy security strategy resorting notably to the launching of an important nuclear energy program in the 1970s. Today, France is in particular equipped with 63 GWe of installed nuclear capacity, which supplies 77% of the electricity produced and 24% of total final energy. As a result, France is today already a relatively low energy consumption country (2.6 toe/cap) and has GHG emission intensities at the lowest end of OECD countries (5.7 tCO2/cap). In the French policy debate, decarbonization was first introduced in 2005 with the adoption of a Factor 4 emission reduction target for 2050, compared with 1990. More recently the discussion on carbon taxation has given rise to several commissions and reports (Quinet 2009, Quinet 2013; Rocard 2009). The experts who drafted the Quinet report in 2009 recommended a carbon tax set at a rate of 32 per ton of CO2 in 2010, rising to 200 (150-350) in 2050 as the implicit value of the constraints for reducing CO2 emissions entailed by the targets for 2020 and 2050. In 2009, France was therefore on the verge of adopting a carbon tax for diffuse emissions (transport and building) that, combined with the ETS for large industries and electricity, would have provided a comprehensive system of economic incentives through carbon prices in all sectors. However, the constitutional council dismissed the law on the eve of its enforcement, while it had already been voted upon by the parliament. More recently, decarbonization has been an important component of the Energy Transition, which has been set as a priority by President Franois Hollande. To investigate this issue, the National Debate on Energy Transition took place in 2013 as a deliberative process between different groups of stakeholders (NGOs, Trade Unions, Business, MPs, Mayors) aiming at identifying and assessing the consequences of different scenarios. Three policy commitments structure the decarbonization scenarios (or energy transition trajectories) for France:  European targets to be translated into domestic objectives: EU 3x20 for 2020 targets (20% reduction in EU GHG from 1990 levels; raising the share of EU energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20%; 20% improvement in the EU's energy efficiency)  Factor 4 reduction of emissions in 2050 compared to 1990 (-75%)  The reduction of the share of nuclear in power generation, down to 50% by 2025, target set in 2012 by President Franois Hollande 85 Key challenges for the French economy and society that are directly or indirectly related to the purpose of decarbonization include: i. ii. iii. iv. the rebuild of industrial competitiveness to counterbalance the de-industrialization observed over the last 40 years (industrys share in the economy has been steadily falling during the last 30 years from 25% in the 1980s to 19% in the 2010s), and the 2.6 million fall of employment in industry. the reduction of energy poverty, which is has become a crucial issue as, in 2010, more than 6% of the French population is below the threshold defining fuel poverty (expenditures on fuel and heating represent more than 10% of income); in particular, low-income households living mostly in rural areas or in small towns spend on average 15% of their income on energy, for housing and transport. a long term effort in directing land and urban planning towards more sustainable patterns through ambitious infrastructure deployment. This is in particular crucial to control mobility needs in a relatively low-density country. the highly controversial issue of nuclear energy beyond 2025. Frances nuclear power plants are, on average, nearly 30-year old and an intense debate concerns the choice between upgrading them with new nuclear plants, extending their service life in some cases, or replacing them altogether with other technologies. GHG emissions in France amounted to 549MtCO2eq and 392MtCO2 in 1990 (excluding LULUCF). In 2010 they were down to 501MtCO2eq and 366MtCO2, respectively a 9% and 7% decrease. LULUCF induce negative emissions (-24MtCO2eq in 1990 and -37MtCO2eq in 2010). Between 70% and 75% of the GHG emissions are CO2 emissions (Figure 1 and Figure 2). 86 The main sector for GHG emissions is the transport sector with 138MtCOe representing 27% of GHG emissions and 38% of CO2 emissions (excluding LULUCF). The 17% increase since 1990 has been mostly triggered by road transport, which represents almost all the emissions from this sector. In the passenger transport sector, the rise of mobility, notably driven by a rise of the distance per capita, has been the main source of sectoral emissions increases, notably because modal breakdown has remained stable at an 80% share for individual cars. Energy efficiency improvements have also been significant, particularly in the last decade, but not sufficient to compensate for the rise of activity levels. In the freight transport sector, the rise of emissions has been driven by a continuous rise of activity levels; indeed, demand for freight transport has increased very fast over the 1990-2008 period (+57%), at an even faster rate than GDP, and the partial decoupling observed since the 2008 economic crisis has only moderated this rise without reversing it. The evolution of the modal breakdown has also played an important role in the increase of carbon emissions, with a continuous decline of rail share (from 27% in 1984 to 8% in 2010) and the domination of road (84% of freight transport in 2010) that were only partially compensated by energy efficiency. According to the governments targets, rail and water transport modal share has to reach 25% in 2022 compared to 14% in 2007. The residential and tertiary sector represents 19% of GHG emissions, and its increase has been driven by demographic trends and a steady increase in the per capita surface. Important decarbonization of the energy consumption happened in the 1980s because of the electrification associated with the nuclear program, and nowadays electricity is one of the main carriers used for heating, which is a French peculiarity. Energy efficiency improvements developed during the 1980s and have been reinforced between 2000 and 2010 notably thanks to the implementation of successive thermal regulations for new buildings and to the introduction of fiscal incentives for thermal retrofitting. 87 Industry represented 18% of GHG emissions in 2010, a 42% fall since 1990, half of it being due to the drop of industrial production over the last three years. The main drivers for the significant decrease in emissions between 1990 and 2010 are the overall decarbonization of the energy used in industry and further improvements in energy efficiency, notably triggered by the European Emission Trading Scheme. In particular, structural evolutions have gone towards a decrease of energy-intensive industries (e.g. - 17% and -27% for steel and cement production respectively), and technical progress has permitted significant reductions of the CO2 content of production (e.g. the diffusion of electric arc furnace for steel production driving the emission rate from 1.78tCO2/t steel in 1990 to 1.32tCO2/t steel in 2010). Agriculture represents 18% of total GHG emissions, N2O, and methane being major contributors (51% and 41% respectively) while CO2 from energy consumption represents only 8%. Major sources of emissions include land fertilization (46%) and enteric fermentation (27%). Between 1990 and 2010 GHG emissions have decreased by 8%, particularly because of the decrease in mineral fertilizing uses, in milk production intensification and in the size of cow livestock. France is characterized by low emissions in the power sector because of the contribution of nuclear (77%) and hydro (11%) energies. On average, current emissions in the power sector amount to 62 gCO2/kWh; this is to be compared with the European average 347 gCO2/kWh. However, due to the weight of nuclear, renewable electricity (excluding hydro) currently represents only 2% of electricity production. The assessment of the Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway for France is based on the results obtained with the IMACLIM-France model, developed at CIRED.21 This Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway combines an overall ambitious energy efficiency improvement program and a diversification of low-carbon energy carriers mobilizing electricity penetration, bioenergy and renewables, or waste heat. Table1. The development indicators and energy service demand drivers in France 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/capita] 65 66 69 71 72 33400 39400 45400 52500 61500 Between 2010 and 2050, economic projections for France anticipate an average annual growth of 1.8%, population is expected to increase by 11%, and the structure of the economy is supposed to be 21 For more information on the IMACLIM modelling platform, see http://www.imaclim.centre-cired.fr/?lang=en 88 stabilized during the next decades. The deep efficiency measures would reduce final energy consumption by nearly 50 percent in 2050 compared to 2010, and electricity, although decreasing by 20% in absolute terms, sees its share increasing from 24% to 39% in 2050. The decrease of the carbon intensity of fuels in end-use sectors is allowed by a division by three of coal consumption and, even more crucial for the transport sector, by a massive substitution of oil by gaseous fuels and biomass. On the supply side, the decrease of the share of nuclear (from 77% in 2010 to 50% in 2025 and 25% in 2050) does not create a rise of carbon emissions because it is accompanied by deep diffusion of renewable electricitymostly hydro, wind and PVwhich increases from 17% in 2010 to 71% in 2050. Under this pathway, buildings and electricity emissions are deeply decarbonized and the core of emissions remaining in 2050 comes from the transport and industry sectors. As for transport, very important reductions are obtained over the 2010-2050 period, but given the high initial emission level transport still represents 30% of 2050 CO2 emissions. Industry becomes the second major emission 89 contributor in 2050 (26%); this is notably because of the assumption of constant structure of the economy which assumes in particular a constant share of energy-intensive industries. Despite the deep electrification of energy consumption, electricity demand slightly decreases over 2010- 2050 as a result of strong efficiency gains in the energy system and a convergence of net exports (30TWh in 2010) to zero by 2050. Power-generation technologies are deeply modified over the period towards a diversification of energy carriers with, in particular, a significant long-term decrease in nuclear share in the mix, a significant increase of renewable energy: in 2050, nuclear represents 25% of production, while wind, photovoltaic, and other non-hydro renewables produce 140TWh, 70TWh and 14TWh respectively. Due to environmental constraints, and in spite of an important technical potential, hydro production is considered to remain stable around 60TWh. Combined-cycle gas turbines are needed to ensure both the transition between the decrease of nuclear and the full deployment of renewables and the balancing of the network with high intermittent sources in the long term. Other energy carriers are also deeply decarbonized thanks to the diffusion of bioenergy: in 2050, second generation biofuels and biogas represent, respectively, 22% of liquid fuels and 53% of gas. 90 (bicycles) In the transport sector, total passenger mobility is stabilized over the period notably thanks to a limitation of urban sprawling, combined with the development of new services for the reduction of mobility (remote working) and the deployment of a functionality economy (car sharing systems), which decrease the global demand for mobility particularly at local level. In parallel, a 30% increase of the modal share of collective transport and soft modes alternatives is permitted by i) organizational measures and infrastructure deployment for urban and local mobility and ii) new investments in rail infrastructures and the retrofitting of existing rail infrastructures. On the technology side, motorization types are diversified to adjust to specific mobility segments (hybrid electric and full electric vehicles) and offer more flexibility in uses (range extender and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). Significant energy efficiency improvements are assumed: +50% for cars (2,5l/100km on average), +20% for buses, +40% for planes. A decoupling of freight volumes and economic activity driving a stabilization of freight demand in the medium and long term is obtained through better logistics and the development of eco-conception or new technologies such as 3D printing. Rail transport reaches 25% of freight transportation in 2050 and water transport is developed. Concerning trucks, major evolutions are energy efficiency improvements (reaching 30% in 2050) and the switch to natural gas. 91 More than two thirds of the dwellings that will exist in 2050 are already built so that efficiency improvement through the thermal retrofitting of existing buildings is a crucial component of the decarbonization strategy. A proactive strategy is necessary to address nearly all existing building (600,000 retrofitting per year after 2020 in the residential sector and 21 Mm2 in the commercial sector) and ambitious improvements per unit are considered (-55% in the commercial sector and -65% in the residential). Additionally and consistently with the measures from the Grenelle de lEnvironnement, standards impose new buildings to consume less than 50 kWh/m2 in 2020 and to reach zero energy consumption after 2020. In parallel, the share of multi-dwelling buildings should increase, inducing only a small increase in the per capita surface. Electricity and off-grid renewables become dominant heating fuels and specific electricity consumption is controlled by a 30% performance improvement for all appliances, corresponding to a pervasive penetration of the most energy efficient appliances currently available. The Illustrative Decarbonization Pathway considers no major change on the structure of production, industry remaining at a constant 20% share in GDP, neither on final industrial energy mix, the decrease of the carbon intensity being essentially due to the development of biogas and of renewable energy. The major breakthrough specific to the industrial sector is a significant reduction of energy consumption, which is obtained by the diffusion of optimized industrial processes (circular economy and industrial ecology principles), combined with 30% energy efficiency gains. 92 While low or zero energy solutions may be relatively easily implemented in new buildings, the retrofitting of existing buildings will have to be implemented at a very large scale, in the range of 600,000 units per year. This will require a combination of technical advancements (incremental innovations in the building practices and radical innovations in materials and control instruments), capacity building in the industry, and specific policy measures to overcome legal and regulatory barriers. The transport pathway is supported by a combination of land and urban planning, organizational innovations, and behavioral changes. Technological innovation is also decisive to promote smart logistics and support the diffusion of alternative motorization types (hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric, full electric, and natural gas vehicles). In particular, the development of natural gas vehicles in France could be facilitated by its development in neighboring countries, which are already adopting this technology, and by the progressive deployment of biogas combined with the decrease in gas consumption for heating. In industry, technological breakthroughs are not central to the Illustrative Decarbonization Pathway; the optimization of industrial practices (circular economy and industrial ecology principles) is the key option to decouple energy use and carbon emissions from production. Finally, energy production is highly decarbonized essentially thanks to power-generation renewables, biogas and biofuels, the development of all these sources being in line with available assessments of their potentials for 2030 (Tanguy & Vidalenc, 2012). After consideration of 16 pre-existing energy scenarios (from NGOs, or academic research, or public agencies), the National Debate on Energy Transition in 2013 identified four families of possible pathways: SOB for sobriety, EFF for efficiency, DIV for diversity, and DEC for decarbonization (Ardity et al., 2012). Each describes contrasted but consistent alternatives for the deep decarbonization of the French energy system along two dividing lines: the level of demand and the energy mix (between a priority to nuclear, to renewables, or to a diversified set of energy carriers). All these trajectories describe a plausible deep decarbonization pathway, since they all reach the Factor 4 emission reduction target (SOB and EFF even reach more ambitious reductions of carbon to leave more flexibility on other GHG gases) and the Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway belongs to the EFF family. The common features among these four pathways are numerous, although each supposes different ambition levels for sector by sector developments, and define a set of minimum requirements to reach the Factor 4 overall target. This concerns in particular:  In the building sector: a deep retrofit of buildings with important efficiency improvements (at least 300,000 units in the residential and 15Mm2 of commercial surface with an average energy efficiency gains of 45%), a phase out of oil product uses for heating and systematic improvements of appliances energy efficiency 93   In the transport sector, a switch from individual cars and trucks to rail and collective transport and important efficiency gains in vehicles (at least 50%) In industry, energy efficiency improvements (at least 20%) and optimization of industrial processes These common features provide a robust identification of the key dimensions of the decarbonization strategies for France. However, the intensity of some actions driving the pace and ultimate potentials of energy demand reduction and of energy decarbonization in the Illustrative Pathway may be questioned. This concerns particularly the retrofit of the whole building stock by 2050 implying 600,000 annual retrofits, the role of biogas as an important combustion fuel, the mix of new technologies, including biofuels, replacing the conventional car (electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and NGV) and the rapid scaling-up as well as high final level for renewable electricity. Should these targets prove to be too difficult to attain, then the decarbonization strategy should integrate the constraints and be adjusted in due time. To compensate for weaker reduction in final energy consumption, a higher level of decarbonization could be sought with more nuclear and more of other decarbonized sources, particularly biomass and waste heat, and finally the introduction of carbon capture and storage, particularly in industry. A DIV  i.e. diversified mix  trajectory would provide such an alternative pathway resorting to less ambitious assumptions on efficiency but still reaching deep emission reductions thanks to more low-carbon supply in due time. It is worth noting that the a DIV-type trajectory can be considered as a second-best pathway, in the sense that it is not the most robust given its dependence upon the availability of a vast set of not currently commercially available technological options (notably CCS); such pathway then offers a solution if it appears that the implementation of an EFF-type trajectory does not allow to reach the deep decarbonization trajectory because of unexpected barriers and difficulties in mobilizing energy efficiency potentials. The Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway relies on the assumption of an economic competitive nuclear in the future. If this assumption proves to be optimistic for future nuclear development, more renewable energies can be mobilized for electricity production reorienting the scenario in a SOB-type trajectory. Some technical options are not considered in the Illustrative Pathway, but play a central role in alternative scenarios presented above, notably:  Methanation: synthetic methane from a recombination of carbon dioxide (from fuel combustion), hydrogen (from renewable electricity), heat and a catalyzer can be used as storage capacity in gas network and as a non-carbon energy for transportation.  Carbon capture and storage: significant storage capacity in the North of France could store 40 MtCO2/year from 2040 mainly for industry.  Nuclear cogeneration, although a sensitive issue, can be used to supply heat for buildings and industry. 94 A crucial challenge for the Illustrative Pathway is associated with the capacity of the agricultural sector to develop an important bio-energy supply with second generation biofuels and biogas for energy substitution. One of the most important instruments to trigger the necessary changes in technologies and behaviors for the energy transition is the implementation of a price signal through carbon taxation, which could be used to lower taxation on labor, to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy development, or be transferred as a lump sum to households, particularly the more vulnerable ones. Whatever the energy pathway, the energy transition would require very large investments amounting to around 2,000 bn over the period (the building retrofitting program only would require between 20 bn and 30 bn each year). Even if the energy transition will more than compensate the extra investment by decreases in the energy bills of households and industries, one of the main barriers to finance the energy transition is the lack of short-term profitability of energy transition investments for private agents: the difference between private discount rates (typically 10-15% p.a. or more) and social discount rates (2-6% p.a.) has since a long time been identified everywhere as the major cause of the efficiency gap. Several proposals for triggering the financing capabilities exist: orienting household savings, such as saving accounts (1,300 bn), in low-carbon investments, creating a public bank such as the KfW in Germany for the thermal retrofitting of buildings, creating an entity for the financing of the energy transition (focusing on the retrofitting program, and on the development of renewable energies) with a guarantee from the State. Employment has become a very central issue of the energy transition debate. Quantitative studies of the energy transition in France conclude to a positive assessment with massive job creation potentials in renewable energy, construction, infrastructures, and collective transports. New skills will have to be developed (for thermal retrofitting for instance) at a very large scale and as rapidly as possible. On the other hand, occupational retraining programs will be needed for jobs in activities such as road freight transport, car industry, or in nuclear energy. With around 10% of active population currently unemployed, the acceptability of energy transition is conditioned upon credible answers for professional transitions in these sectors. Concrete examples of energy transition actions such as building retrofitting, optimizing local renewable resources in function of specific uses, developing networks for heat or for gas, show that concrete actions already happen at local level. Energy issues are indeed directly linked to many other local policies: urban planning, local transports, wastes, housing , and also social policies at the urban or municipality levels. Regional authorities are already in charge of transportation, land planning, economic development and training. Participatory processes are also an element of acceptability of energy transition. Further, by empowering local governance systems, national policies could leverage existing 95 local experiments, accelerate policy responses, foster resource mobilization, and engage local stakeholders. The long term Factor 4 objective that became a legal target in 2005 is an important catalyst for climate policies by stabilizing expectations of consumers and economic agents in their low-carbon investment decisions; a medium to long-term stability of climate policies is needed. Although this target has been unopposed by any stakeholder group since its very first introduction by the Mission Interministrielle pour lEffet de Serre in 2003, some governmental decisions apparently contradictory to official objectives have been observed notably for wind and photovoltaic policies: administrative decisions impose new constraints on wind development and, since 2011, the feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic are revised every 3 months. As a result, wind and PV development have significantly slowed down and the 20% target for renewable energy development in 2020 may become unattainable. The implementation a pre-established increasing carbon price would be central for a full environmental and economic efficiency of public policies. Ambitious EU and international climate energy objectives are also of paramount importance for numerous reasons: leverage effect of EU objectives and induced directives on national policies, credibility and acceptability of national policies, industrial strategies for low carbon technologies and economic competitiveness issues. Near-term sectoral priorities should focus on renewable energy development and the implementation of the building retrofitting plan. These two actions are crucial for any deep decarbonization pathway in France, but face strong inertias (both because they are associated to long-lived infrastructure and require the development of specific skills that are not currently available), which make early development crucial. In addition, these actions have strong potential positive effects on employment that can increase the social and political desirability of these measures. In addition, specific financing mechanisms must be conceived to support in particular the massive retrofitting program and a carbon price has to be rapidly implemented, even at a low level during the first years, but with a pre-established increasing rate (in the range of 4-5% p.a., the level of the social discount rate), in order to reach a level near to the 100 /tCO2 in 2030 that has been already identified as consistent with the policy targets. 96 Ardity, M., et al., 2012.

Located between the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, it bridges two continents: Asia and Oceania. It consists of approximately 17,000 islands with a population of 234 million. The majority (almost 80%) of Indonesians live in the Western part of Indonesia on the islands of Jawa and Sumatera (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Map of Indonesia with basic statistics Fossil fuels have historically been the major source of energy in Indonesia. Out of the 189 Mtoe of primary energy supply in 2011, oil accounts for almost half at 46.3%. The remainder is provided by coal (26.1%), natural gas (20.4%), commercial biomass (3.4%), hydro (2.4%), and geothermal (1.3%). In addition to this commercial energy, traditional biomass is still used for cooking in rural areas. The major energy consumers in Indonesia are industry (46.1%) and transport (35.6%). The remaining 18.3% is shared by residential (11%), commercial (4.2%), and agriculture, mining and construction (3.2%). The majority of final energy consumption is in the form of fuels (oil, coal, gas, and biomass comprise 88%), and the remaining 12% of final energy is provided as electricity. Indonesias electrification rate (the percent of the population with access to electricity) is around 78%, with a low per capita annual consumption of 660 kWh/capita. Given that the country is an archipelago with many islands and remote rural communities, a large number of Indonesians do not have access to electricity. Fossil fuels are the dominant source of energy for electricity generation; coal, natural gas, and oil respectively represent 98 Kalimantan(5.8%) Sulawesi (7.1%)Papua(1.5%)Jawa(58%)Bali (1.6%)Nusa Tenggara (3.8%)MalukuJakarta1.9 million km2land area; 7.9 million km2maritime area54,700 km coast line33 provinces, 497 cities/regencies(..%): percent of populationMajor cities 42%, 32%, and 12% of the generation mix. The remaining 13% is provided by hydropower (8%) and geothermal (5%). Indonesia developed with this dependency on fossil fuels in part because of the countrys energy resource endowment, which includes 120 billion tons of coal, 8 billion barrels of oil, and 150 Trillion Standard Cubic Feet (TSCF) of natural gas. In addition to fossil energy, Indonesia is also endowed with renewable energy resources, including 75 GW of hydro,22 29 GW of geothermal, 50 GW of biomass, and solar energy potential of 4.5 kWh/m2/day. Indonesia is a developing nation with a GDP of 847 billion US$ (2012). The per capita GDP in 2012 was 3,592 US$. Over the past 5 years, the countrys annual economic growth fluctuated between 4.3% and 5.9%. The Indonesian economy has shifted from one that was highly dependent on agriculture to one that is more industry and service-based. In 2012, the composition of the economy was: 47% industry, 38% service, and 15% agriculture. It is expected that the Indonesian economy will move further toward a service-based economy in the future. Despite continuous economic growth, many Indonesians are still poor, with approximately 11% of the population living below the poverty line. In the next three decades, the Indonesian population is expected to grow at approximately 1% each year, and employment for this additional population is critical. To lift the population out of poverty, the government plans to promote economic growth that averages at least 5% per year and has set a goal of reducing the poverty rate to below 4% by 2025. Historically, energy has not been used efficiently in Indonesia because prices were kept artificially low through government subsidies. These subsidies have helped fuel an increase in energy use; average annual growth of energy consumption has been larger than average annual GDP growth. Through efficiency measures, the government hopes to reverse this trend by 2025. It is also expected that remote, rural communities will be electrified using local renewable resources such as microhydro power and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. The government has set a goal that all households will have access to electricity by 2025, and plans for energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable energy resources have put Indonesia on a deep decarbonization pathway. According to the Indonesian Second National Communication (which reports the latest official figures concerning the countrys emissions), Indonesian GHG emissions were around 1,800 MtCO2e in 2005 (see Figure 1). This represents an increase of 400 MtCO2e compared to 2000. Most emissions (63%) come from land use change and peat fire, and combustion of fossil fuels contributes around 19% of the emissions. In the fuel combustion category, coal is the major emission source (see Figure 2). The second major source is oil combustion. Coal is the main fuel in power generation as well as a major energy source for industrial activities. Oil is used in the transport and building sectors. In the end-use sector, one-half of the direct combustion emissions are from fuel burning in industrial activities. Emissions from power generation come from the building (60%) and industry (40%) sectors. 22 This is a resource potential, based on preliminary resource surveys. Assuming this could be converted into technical potentials and with capacity factor of 40%, then this resource will generate 263 TWh per year. As comparison, in 2010 the generation of hydropower was 16 TWh. Many of the hydro resources are located in Eastern Indonesia, far from electric demand center in the West. Transmission from East to West requires construction of undersea cables. 99 Source: Second National Communication Indonesia As shown in Figure 3, the main driver of GHG emissions over the past decade has been economic activity, which increased at a rate of 5% to 6% per year. Increasing energy use per unit of GDP also contributed to the increase in emissions, showing that the economy simultaneously grew more energy- intensive. 100 As a developing nation, the Indonesian economy and population are projected to grow significantly in the next four decades. The projections for these energy service demand drivers and other relevant development indicators are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Development Indicators and Energy Service Demand Drivers Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/capita] Access to Electricity Poverty indicator 14,974 2,306 70% 12% 99% 3% 99% 2% 85% 8% 99% 3% 2050 3,655 5,823 9,319 2010 2020 2030 2040 234 252 271 289 307 To achieve significant decarbonization, Indonesia has to drastically change its energy supply and demand mix (see Figure 4). The following are the important features of decarbonization in primary energy: reduce oil consumption, reduce coal share and equip most of the remaining coal plants with CCS, increase the share of natural gas and equip a significant fraction of gas plants with CCS, significantly increase the share of renewables, and begin to use nuclear power. The important features of decarbonization in final energy are: significantly decrease use of coal, increase the share of natural gas, significantly reduce oil consumption, and significantly increase share of electricity. The drastic change of the primary as well as the final energy mix is the result of many measures. As shown in Figure 5, the illustrative Indonesian decarbonization pathway is a combination of energy 101 efficiency, low- and zero-carbon emitting technologies, and structural changes in the economy. The key elements of the pathway are as follows:  Energy efficiency improvements would be deployed in all sectors.  The deployment of lower-carbon emitting energy sources would be realized in part through fuel switching from coal to gas, oil to gas, and a switch from onsite fuel combustion to use of electricity. The remaining large energy systems that burn fossil fuels would be equipped with CCS technology.  Further fuel switching to renewable resources is a critical component of the scenario in all sectors: solar, hydro, and geothermal for power generation, biofuels in transport, and biomass, biofuels, and biogas in industry.  Structural changes in the economy (i.e. decreased role of industry in the formation of national GDP through service sector substitution) are expected to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy sector. By implementing these strategies, the energy-related Indonesian CO2 emissions will change in a sustainable manner by realizing deep decarbonization by 2050. As shown in Figure 6, industry and power generation remain the major sources of emissions in 2050. Significant decarbonization will occur in the power sector, from 130 MtCO2 in 2010 to 68 MtCO2 in 2050. Despite decarbonization efforts, emissions from industrial sector will continue to increase, from 155 MtCO2 in 2010 to 221 MtCO2 in 2050. 102 As shown in Figure 2, land use change and forestry are the main sources of GHG emissions, and they will continue to be so without new strategies in these areas. Therefore these sources have been targeted for reduction as part of the national emissions reduction commitment. The emissions from this sector mainly come from deforestation, forest degradation, and peat emissions. A decrease in emissions can be accomplished through six strategies: (i) the acceleration of establishment of a forest management unit (FMU) in all forest areas to ensure the improvement of forest management, (ii) the introduction of mandatory forest certification systems to reduce illegal logging and increase the application of sustainable management practices, (iii) a reduced dependency on natural forests in meeting wood demands by increasing the use of low-carbon stock lands or degraded lands for the development of timber plantation and enhancement of carbon sequestration by increasing forest regeneration and land rehabilitation, (iv) the reduction of forest conversion in meeting land demand for agriculture by increasing the productivity of the existing agricultural land and planting intensity as well as optimizing the cultivation of unproductive lands, (v) a restriction on the use of peat land for agricultural development and the implementation of low-emission technologies in peat land, and (vi) the issuance of financing/incentive policies and the development of a financing system to support the implementation of the first five strategies. The implementation of the above strategies could significantly reduce GHG emissions in these sectors from about 3.42tCO2e/capita (about 800 MtCO2e) in 2010 to about -1.08tCO2e/cap (about -330 MTCO2e) in 2050. These sources could become a net-sink of CO2 emissions by 2030 at a rate of about - 0.29tCO2e/cap (about 80 MtCO2e).23 23 It is assumed that all government targets on wood, palm oil, and rice production are met. The government target for wood production from natural forest will be stable at about 18.54 million m3/year (starting from 2020-2050), and timber plantation will reach 360 million m3 by 2050. The area for palm oil plantation, which is now about 9.27 million ha, will increase to 15 million ha by 2050, and rice production will meet domestic demand (self sufficiency). The land demand for settlement and commercial building will increase following the population growth. 103 As mentioned above, Indonesias primary energy mix is currently dominated by fossil fuels. Oil, coal and gas together account for 93% of the energy supply, and the remaining 7% comes from renewable energy resources (biomass, hydropower, and geothermal). The end users of the energy are the industrial sector (50%), transport (34%), and building (16%). The breakdown of types of energy on the end user side is as follows: liquids (54%), gas (18%), coal (15%), and electricity (11%). To achieve decarbonization, a major transformation will take place in the energy system, including the electrification of transport and industry and deployment of renewables and application of CCS. Another important element of the decarbonization pathway is a significant increase in the share of biofuels in transportation, industry, and power generation. To ensure sustainability, the feedstock of biofuels would be planted in unused land (without disturbing forest stock), and as time progresses and new technology is developed, the feedstock will come from waste biomass. Electricity demand will increase significantly with economic development and a shift of energy use in residential, industrial, and transport toward electricity. In the power sector, the decarbonization strategy includes fuel switching to lower-carbon emitting fuels (coal to gas, oil to gas), massive deployment of CCS for remaining coal and gas power plants, and extensive deployment of renewables (solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biofuels). Deep decarbonization in power generation will also require deployment of nuclear power plants and efficiency improvements in existing power plants. A summary of this decarbonization pathway is shown in Figure 7. Electricity demand will grow 5% per annum on average, from 158 TWh in 2010 to 1,083 TWh in 2050. Decarbonization in this sector will result in a decrease in the average CO2 emission factor, from 825 gCO2/kWh in 2010 to 63 gCO2/kWh in 2050, and the CO2 emissions of the electricity generation will decrease from 130 MtCO2 in 2010 to 68 MtCO2 in 2050. 104 To achieve deep decarbonization, it is assumed that there would need to be a significant switch from petroleum fuels to biofuels. Figure 7b shows the trajectory of the total liquid fuels used in transport, industry, and power generation and their associated carbon intensity. Fuel switching to lower-carbon fuels and bioenergy (solid biomass wastes and biofuels) is the dominant strategy for decarbonization in the industrial sector. In addition, CO2 emission reductions are also realized through industrial efficiency improvement (decreasing energy intensity) and CCS for coal and gas in heavy industry. These decarbonization measures would reduce the emission intensity of fuels in industry sector from 3.81 tCO2/toe in 2010 to 1.88 tCO2/toe in 2050. The trajectory of industrial energy use and the associated emission intensities are shown in Figure 8a. A decreased share of industry and heavy industry in the national economy would also contribute to the emission reductions. It is expected that the share of industry in GDP will decrease from 27.8% in 2010 to 17% in 2050. Improvements in efficiency are expected to reduce industrial energy intensity from 365 toe/M$ in 2010 to 229 toe/M$ in 2050. 105 Note: Carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. The energy demand in the transport sector is expected to increase significantly with economic development and population growth. In the passenger transport sector the decarbonization strategy includes modal shift to mass transport, electrification of vehicles, fuel switching to less-carbon emitting fuels (oil to gas), use of more energy-efficient vehicles, and extensive use of biofuels. Similar strategies are also applied to freight transport. A shift of freight transport from road to railway is expected to decrease CO2 emissions. As a result of modal shift, it is expected that the share of personal vehicles decreases from 60% in 2010 to 40% in 2050. In 2050, it is expected that 30% of personal cars are electric vehicles. Decarbonization of this sector is expected to reduce the emission intensity from 3.02 tCO2/toe in 2010 to 1.73 tCO2/toe in 2050. Figure 8b shows the trajectory of energy use and the associated emission intensities of transport sector. Decarbonization in the building sector would result primarily from fuel switching from oil to gas/LPG and from fuels to electricity along with more efficient electric equipment. Switching from on-site fuel combustion to electricity would reduce direct emissions from buildings, and with a decarbonized electricity generation sector, this switch would lead to emission reductions. For the residential sector, increasing per capita income will increase energy consumption, but this will be balanced by more efficient equipment and the expectation that homes will remain relatively small. The trajectory of buildings energy use is shown in Figure 8c. 106 The deep decarbonization of energy activities in Indonesia can only be achieved through a combination of measures: efficiency, fuel switching (including to electricity), deployment of renewable, nuclear, and CCS and structural change of the economy, especially in the industrial sector. The success of the countrys decarbonization pathway is obviously dependent on the realization of many assumptions used in its development. Indonesian hydropower plants under the illustrative scenario would generate around 37 GW in 2050, which is approximately half of the total hydro resources (75 GW). Indonesian geothermal resources would amount to around 29 GW, which supports the 25 GW of geothermal power assumed in the scenario. As a tropical country with an average radiation of 1.45 kWh/m2/day, it is reasonable for Indonesia to envisage a scenario where 75 GW solar power is used in 2050. For energy security reasons, Indonesia will most likely continue to use its abundant coal resources for electricity generation. However, most of the plants will be equipped with CCS facilities to capture CO2 and store it in geological formation. Given the need for deep decarbonization, CCS will also be used to reduce emissions from natural gas power plants. The total CO2 that would need to be stored by 2050 equals about 3,300 Mton (with an annual value of 286 Mton). The storage is assumed to take place in the abandoned and depleted oil and gas reservoirs in Indonesia. It is estimated that the volume of Indonesian depleted reservoirs could store around 11,000 Mton, which is more than three times the space required by the CCS scenario. Deep decarbonization also includes the massive use of biofuels for transport, industry, and power generation. In 2050, the total biofuel demand would be around 85 Mton per year. Based on current technological standards, to meet this biofuel demand domestically, around 18 million ha of land are needed to grow the biofuel feedstock. Indonesia currently has around 8 million ha of land devoted to crude palm oil (CPO) production, which could be used as biofuel feedstock. The additional 10 million ha of land needed to support biofuel for decarbonization would be available from unused non-forest land, which is estimated to be around 50 million ha. Power generation is one of the major contributors of CO2 emissions. Under the current pathway, the main tool of decarbonization is coal and gas CCS. Therefore, the uncertainty of the pathway lies in the uncertainty of CCS deployment. There is only a limited amount of research into the scale of geological formation for CCS in Indonesia. The suitability of the CCS scenario is based on the assumption that the CO2 will be injected in depleted gas and oil reservoirs. If all of this storage does not become available, the alternatives to CCS include: more hydropower, biomass, and solar. An increase in the use of hydropower would require the construction of long subsea cables, as the location of large hydro resource is in Eastern Indonesia, while the demand center is in Western Indonesia. If half of the CCS envisaged in the illustrative scenario could not be realized, hydro would need to be increased from 30 GW to 61 GW, and biomass would need to increase from 15 GW to 20 GW. The increase in solar power would eventually be constrained by concerns for grid reliability associated with resource intermittency. Under the illustrative scenario, the share of intermittent renewables is only around 14%. If 107 the use of hydropower were limited below what is assumed in this scenario, solar could be substantially increased before reaching reliability limits, which are estimated to occur above a 25% threshold. More aggressive efforts to substitute internal combustion engine cars with electric vehicles (EVs) would help further reduce direct emissions in the transportation sector. Under the illustrative pathway, the share of EVs in personal cars is 30% in 2050. It may be further increased to 50% in 2050. Also, more electrification in the light industry will reduce direct emissions. Under the current pathway, the light duty fleet is 35% EVs in 2050. This level of electrification could conceivably be increased to 50%. The feasibility of this increase, however, requires further research. An increase in electrified transportation and industry will create more emissions in the power sector; the low-electric emission factor must therefore be maintained. As mentioned above, additional hydropower and geothermal power could be harnessed to support this increased load. To utilize the remaining large hydropower resource, it would be necessary to construct a subsea electricity transmission line, given that the resource is located far away from the demand center. The Indonesian illustrative decarbonization pathway is primarily composed of technological changes that are very different from the current mix of energy technologies. Many of the technologies are still in their infancy (e.g. CCS, electric vehicles, high efficiency power plants, etc.). The realization of the pathway is highly dependent on the development and maturation of these technologies in the coming years, and the technological approach would require massive development of new infrastructure (e.g. infrastructure for enabling mass public transport, new railways, gas transmission, subsea electrical transmissions, and CCS facilities). As a result, one of the main challenges of the pathway is how to finance the infrastructure investment. Some of the commercially available technologies, such as solar, biofuel and geothermal power, are currently more expensive than conventional fossil fuel technologies. Wide-scale deployment of these low-carbon resources would therefore require further technology development to lower costs, making them competitive with conventional resources. Deployment of nuclear power also poses a special challenge: social acceptability. It is therefore necessary to explore how to convince Indonesians that nuclear power is a necessary part of the future energy mix. In 2009, the Indonesian Government announced a non-binding commitment to reduce its emissions 26% by 2020 (compared to business as usual development). However, being a non-Annex I country, concern for climate change is not yet fully internalized in Indonesian development agenda. To embrace a deep decarbonization pathway, the government has to first adopt climate change as a key component of its national development agenda. In summary, significant efforts are necessary for a deep decarbonization pathway to be realized: internalizing climate change into the national agenda, financing for investments in infrastructure, technology development, technology transfer, a social campaign for nuclear, and the right energy 108 pricing policy for renewables. To overcome some of these challenges, international cooperation is needed, especially for infrastructure financing and technology transfer. Deep decarbonization is a long-term development objective, and the incorporation of climate change in the Indonesian national agenda has just begun. To embrace deep decarbonization, Indonesia must continue to internalize climate change in the political sphere. Nevertheless, there are a number of near- term actions that need to be taken now to begin implementing a decarbonization pathway:  The modal shift to public transport was initiated decades ago, but the success of these efforts has been limited. One of the barriers is that investment in public transport has been limited. As a result, new efforts to explore financing options for the transportation sector are needed.  Biofuels were introduced into the Indonesian energy system in 2005. However, the use of this fuel is currently limited. One of the barriers is that biofuels have to compete with subsidized petroleum diesel and gasoline. Though recently the government has subsidized biofuels, increased policies to promote biofuel development are needed. Currently biofuel production uses traditional feedstocks that are also needed for the food sector, i.e. crude palm oil and molasses. Research and development into other biofuel feedstocks must be emphasized.  Some technologies that are envisaged in the pathway, such as electric vehicles and CCS, are new to Indonesia. Research, development, and demonstration of these technologies needs to be conducted over a number of years in order to make progress.  The key challenge of deep decarbonization is the financing of low-carbon infrastructure. The government, therefore, has to begin to look for international cooperation and find assistance for infrastructure development. In addition, the government must seek international partners for the technology transfer of technologies necessary for deep decarbonization. 109 The Japanese economy is characterized by low domestic reserves of fossil fuels, which makes it highly dependent upon importations. This situation has raised important energy security issues since the 1950s when Japan has turned from domestic coal and hydro to imported oil to fuel its fast economic growth. After the first oil shock in the 1970s, Japans energy policy priorities have shifted to be framed around the three pillars of energy security, environment protection, and economic efficiency, with in particular the development of nuclear, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and imported coal to limit the dependency on oil. The focus on energy security and climate change has favored the development of renewables and the domination of nuclear power, which has been the most important energy source until the Daiichi Nuclear Power plant accident in March 2011. Energy strategies have changed after the 2011 accident. The Innovative Strategy for Energy and the Environment (2012) and the comments on Basic Energy Plan by Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy (ACNRE, 2013) concluded that the dependency on nuclear power should be decreased; consequently, the power generation from nuclear power decreased substantially in 2012 from its level in 2010 and import of fossil fuels, especially LNG, increased in spite of energy efficiency improvement in end-use sector. To achieve the political GHG mitigation target of reducing 80% emissions compared to the 1990 level by 2050 with lower nuclear dependence, it is utmostly necessary to reduce energy consumption by reducing energy service demands and by increasing the use of energy saving technologies, and to increase the share of renewable energies. As the potential of renewable energies is unevenly distributed, regional electricity exchange is required. The major renewable energy capacity is not located in the major electricity demand regions such as Kanto area but in the rural regions such as Hokkaido and Tohoku areas. However current electricity interconnection capacity between regions is not high in Japan and strengthening interconnections is therefore a crucial issue. Total GHG emissions in 2010 (excluding LULUCF) amounted to 1,256 MtCO2eq in Japan of which CO2 represented a large majority (1,191 MtCO2 or 94.8%) (Figure 1a). The sectoral decomposition shows that three activities were dominantly responsible for these CO2 emissions at this date (Figure 1b): power generation, notably because the power sector was largely fueled by imported coal and LNG (even in 2010 before nuclear was partly removed from the power generation mix); industry, because the 110 industrial sector plays a very important role in the Japanese economy notably for exports; and transport sector, because the vehicle transports of both passenger and freight traffic were increased. Moreover, although shares of commercial and residential sectors are not large, the emissions from these sectors have increased because of increasing distribution of electrical appliances. At the same time, the emissions from the industry sector have reduced continuously since 1990, and those from the transport sector have reduced since 2000. The trends demonstrate a continuous but moderate increase of total CO2 emissions over 1990-2007 (+14%) before recent drastic changes (-8% between 2008 and 2010 after the economic crisis and +7% between 2010 and 2012 because the closure of nuclear plants after Fukushima triggered a temporary increase of fossil importations). Source: Greenhouse Inventory Office of Japan24 2007 saw the most GHG emissions for the 1990 to 2010 period, which was a 15% increase from base year under the Kyoto Protocol (KPBY). The total GHG emissions in 2010 decreased by 0.4% compared to the emissions in the base year under KPBY (excluding LULUCF). Since 2010, GHG emissions have resumed to increase and accounted for 1,343 MtCO2eq in 2012. They increased by 6.5% compared to KPBY. During the 1st commitment period, GHG emissions increased by 1.4% compared to KPBY. On the other hand, if the carbon sink of LULUCF and credit of Kyoto Mechanism are counted, the GHG emissions during the 1st commitment period amount to 1,156 MtCO2eq, a 8.4% decrease from KPBY. 24 http://www-gio.nies.go.jp/aboutghg/nir/nir-e.html 111 In Figure 2, the decomposition of drivers of changes in CO2 emission from fuel combustion over 1990- 2012 demonstrates that the Japanese economy has experienced a continuous diffusion of energy efficiency permitting an average 0.7% annual rate of production energy intensity decrease. The other Kaya drivers did not have such a consistent effect in that period. Until 2007, growth of GDP per capita has been the major driver of CO2 emission increase, while there was a substantial decrease in 2008 and 2009 due to the global economic recession. In 2011 and 2012, the contribution of improvement of energy efficiency was neutralized by the increase of carbon intensity due mainly to the suspension of nuclear plants after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 and the resulting comeback of fossil fuels. In line with declining birthrate and growing proportion of elderly people, both total and active Japanese populations are expected to experience a significant decrease between 2010 and 2050, by 24% and 39% respectively as shown in Table 1. Despite the decline in population, the continuous rise of GDP per capita is projected to be sufficient to ensure a steady rise of total GDP (from about 5.38 trillion USD in 2010 to 8.37 trillion USD in 2050). The deep decarbonization pathways in Japan are assessed using AIM/Enduse model.25 Table 1 summarizes the major socio-economic indicators used in the estimation of deep decarbonization pathways in Japan. The indicators are taken from the assumption by Working Group of Technology 25 AIM/Enduse model is a dynamic recursive, technology selection model for the mid- to long-term mitigation policy assessment, developed by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Kyoto University and Mizuho Information Research Institute. This model has already been applied to assess the mitigation target in Japan. The model applied for the deep decarbonization pathways is a multi-region version of AIM/Enduse model of Japan, that is to say, the model is composed of 10 regions and considers the regional differences in renewable energy potential and energy demand characteristics. The 10 regions almost coincide with the business areas of 10 public power supply firms. 112 Perspective of Central Environmental Council in Japan and the estimation of population by National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.

Report on measures and policies after 2013. In Japans illustrative deep decarbonization scenario, the long-term GHG emission reduction target is achieved by large scale energy demand reduction in end-use sector and decarbonization in power generation sector including deployment of CCS. In parallel with continuous growth in GDP per capita, improvements of both energy efficiency and carbon intensity become the major drivers to substantial CO2 emissions reductions in the mid and long terms. Total final energy consumption in 2050 decreases substantially and accounts for approximately 50% of the 2010 level (Figure 3, right panel). Particularly in transport sector, the pace of energy demand reduction is the most rapid in the mid- to long terms, followed by residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The shift to public transport, fuel efficiency improvement, and efficiency improvement of transportation service will promote the reduction of CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Dependency on fossil fuel is reduced substantially compared to the 2010 level due to reduction in energy demand and deployment of renewable energy. In 2050, fossil fuel consumption falls by approximately 60% compared to the 2010 level with an approximate 35% decrease of total primary energy supply and increase in share of renewable energy which accounts for approximately 40% (including hydropower) of total primary energy supply in 2050 despite almost complete phase out of nuclear power (Figure 3, left panel). Among the fossil fuels, natural gas and oil (including non-energy use) exist in 2050 while coal is almost phased out because of its high carbon intensity. Natural gas supply increases in the mid term in place of oil and coal because of its lower carbon intensity, but falls to the 2010 level by 2050 along with energy demand reduction and large-scale deployment of renewable energy. Hence, natural gas without CCS acts as a bridge technology. 113 114 The nuclear power is assumed to be phased out gradually (see next section for more extensive discussion) and electricity generation from coal without CCS is entirely phased out by 2050. Renewable energy is developed over the mid to long terms and reaches approximately 59% of total electricity generation through large-scale deployments of solar PV and wind power (Figure 6). In addition, natural gas (equipped with CCS) is developed to ensure balancing of the network and reaches about a third of total electricity generation in 2050. Due to large-scale deployment of renewable energy and natural gas equipped with CCS, carbon intensity of electricity falls to nearly zero in 2050. In 2050, approximately 199 MtCO2 is captured by CCS technologies and cumulative captured CO2 reaches about 3,096 MtCO2. This represents about 60% of the potential of CO2 storage in an anticlinal structure (the well and seismic exploration data for Japan is estimated by RITE)26. 26 The potential storage of CO2 in an anticlinal structure where well and seismic exploration data accounts for about 5.2 Gt. In addition, the potential storage in existing oil/gas fields represents about 3.5 Gt. Moreover, the total potential storage capacity can be 146 Gt including the storage in geological structure with stratigraphic trapping, etc. (http://www.rite.or.jp/English/lab/geological/survey.html). According to the report by Central Environmental Council in Japan, it is suggested that about a half of the potential capacity can be economically attractive by 2050 (http://www.env.go.jp/council/06earth/r064-03/ccs.pdf (in Japanese)). 115 The industrial sector is the largest emitter: its CO2 emissions represent about 40% of total GHG emission in 2050 because fuel demand for high temperature heat is hardly replaced by low-carbon sources. Activity levels demonstrate a moderation of activity in energy-intensive sectors in line with restructuring of the Japanese industry: -23% for crude steel production (from 111 Mt in 2010 to 85 Mt in 2050) and -11% for cement (from 56Mt in 2010 to 50 Mt in 2050). Combined with energy efficiency, this ensures a reduction of final energy consumption by more than 30%. Fuel switching, and notably the phase-out of coal without CCS, contributes to improve significantly the carbon intensity of energy in the mid to long terms (Figure 7a). Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. In residential and commercial sectors, final energy demand is reduced by approximately 60%, in line with a stability of commercial floor space (+3% only, from 18,3 Mm2 in 2010 to 19 Mm2 in 2050) and a 17% decrease of the number of households, hence reducing energy service needs in the residential sector. It is worth noting that fossil fuels (notably gas) remain important in the transition (until 2030), thus explaining a temporary rise of the carbon intensity before electricity becomes the dominant energy over the long term, hence ensuring a significant decrease of the carbon intensity in this sector in 2050. In the transportation sector, CO2 emissions in 2050 reduce by almost 80% compared to the 1990 level and account for about 17% of Japans GHG emissions, as shown in Figure 4. In a context of a reduction of passenger total mobility (-10% of passenger transport demand) corresponding to an increase of 116 mobility per person, the 18% decoupling of freight transport relative to production is made possible by a combination of energy efficiency, electrification of the fleet, as well as hydrogen and a small diffusion of gas-fueled vehicles (for freight), reaching in total almost 50% of energy consumed, substitute for oil- based fuels and ensuring a continuous decrease of the carbon intensity of fuels in 2050 (Figure 7c). A wide range of low-carbon technologies is taken into account in Japans illustrative scenario, and include:     In electricity supply: efficiency improvement of power generation, coal and gas with CCS, reduced T&D (Transmission & Distribution) line losses, wind power, solar PV, geothermal, bioenergy. In industry: energy efficiency improvement, electrification wherever feasible in industrial processes, natural gas use, CCS for iron making and cement lime, fuel economy improvement of agricultural machine, bioenergy use, nitrogen fertilizer management. In buildings: improvement of the energy efficiency performance of buildings, high-efficiency equipment and appliances, electric heat pump water heaters, energy management system. In transport: energy efficiency improvement, gas-powered heavy duty vehicles (HDVs), vehicle electrification, hydrogen vehicles. As future availability of nuclear power is still uncertain in Japan, electricity generation from nuclear plants and availability of nuclear power is based on the premises of New Policies Scenario of World Energy Outlook 2013 published by International Energy Agency. According to the illustrative scenario, nuclear plants lifetime is limited to 40 years for plants built up to 1990 and 50 years for all other plants, and during 2013 to 2035 an additional 3 GW nuclear plants capacity is included. Subject to these assumptions and maximum capacity factor of 70% for all plants, electricity generation from nuclear plants represents about 50 TWh in 2050. Complying with previous studies, CCS technologies are assumed to be available from 2025 and annual CO2 storage volume is assumed to increase up to 200 MtCO2/year in 2050. The potential of storage of CO2 is set to be around 5 GtCO2. CCS technology can be applied to both power generation and industrial sectors. In the power generation sector, both coal plants and natural gas plants can be equipped with CCS technology, but bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) is excluded in this analysis. For industrial use, CCS technologies are available in iron and steel and cement sectors. In 2050, the amount of captured CO2 in the iron and steel sector and the cement sector reaches about 60 MtCO2 and 20 MtCO2, respectively. A maximum capture rate of CO2 by CCS technologies is assumed to be 90% for all CCS technologies. In Japan, as the regions with large potential of renewable energy are different from the ones with large electricity consumption, reinforcement of interconnection capacity would be helpful to facilitate more effective use of local renewable sources. In the illustrative scenario, due to reinforcement of electricity interconnection, carbon price to achieve 80% reduction target is reduced by about 9% because power 117 generation from renewable energy in Hokkaido and Tohoku regions becomes available in Tokyo region, the largest electricity consumer in Japan. The capacity of interconnection between Tohoku and Tokyo region is tripled during 2010 to 2050. Deployment of battery electric vehicle (BEV), heat pump water heater, and converting electricity into hydrogen can provide flexibility to electricity system through implementation of demand side management. In 2050, electricity peak demand in daytime becomes higher relative to off-peak demand, and this necessitates integration of substantial solar PV into electricity system. The Illustrative Pathway considers a gradual phase-out of nuclear but it still represents 19% of electricity generation in 2030 and 5% in 2050. However, no nuclear plant has been in operation since the end of 2013, though some nuclear plants have been put under safety inspection by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, and it is possible that a complete phase-out is decided. Therefore, it is worth considering a pathway that would consider a complete phase-out of nuclear to assess robustness of deep decarbonization pathways. In this scenario, no nuclear plant is assumed to restart in the entire period of estimation after 2014. In such an alternative pathway, higher carbon intensity is experienced during the transition period where coal and gas without CCS compensates the gap caused by the phase-out of nuclear. But the impact of nuclear phase-out as compared to the illustrative scenario is relatively small in the long term, given the small share of nuclear in 2050 in any case. An 80% emission reduction in 2050 is still feasible with additional deployment of renewable energy and natural gas equipped with CCS. As the feasibility of deep decarbonization pathways crucially depends on the availability of CCS, a Limited CCS Scenario is prepared to assess further robustness. In this scenario, CO2 storage volume is limited to 100 MtCO2/year (half of the volume assumed in the Illustrative Scenario) and cumulative captured CO2 reach about 1,550 MtCO2. Achieving long-term emission reduction target proves to be still feasible with substantial increase of renewable energy, particularly solar PV and wind power, in the long-term electricity supply, in place of natural gas equipped with CCS. In the scenario, the share of renewable energy in electricity supply reaches approximately 85% in 2050 and intermittent renewable energies account for about 63% in electricity generation in 2050, hence imposing a further challenge for integration into the electricity system. The utilization of the technologies that provide the desired flexibility, such as pumped hydro plants and demand side management using battery electric vehicles can be helpful to integrate large amount of variable renewable energies (VREs). The following measures should be considered for deeper decarbonization. 118 The technologies listed in Table 2 are proven energy-saving technologies up to 2050. On the other hand, further improvement in energy efficiency of low-carbon technology beyond the levels assumed in the scenario analysis and development of innovative technology provide additional potential to reduce emission, especially in the industrial sector. In addition, system technologies such as reinforcement of electricity interconnection and demand side management system would be helpful for effective deeper decarbonization. Both in the illustrative scenario and in alternative pathways, substantial change in lifestyle and reduction of energy service demand is not considered. However, behavioral change has further potential to reduce energy demand affordably while maintaining the standard of living. For example, the material stock in developed countries is likely to saturate, and developing countries will also catch up with the developed countries in the future. The enhancement of service economy or stock economy will be able to reduce the material demand, and as a result, energy demand will reduce. Analyzing these effects could help with more refined assessment of deeper pathways. Both in the illustrative scenario and in alternative pathways, substantial change in material production is not considered. However, with existing stock level of infrastructure and decline in future population, a small amount of material production to maintain the stock level is likely to be sufficient. For example, stock of steel in developed countries is estimated to be 4.9-10.6 ton per capita. If the quantities of material production are controlled, the energy service demand in industrial sector could be reduced further, and as a result, CO2 emissions also could reduce. Further reduction in emission and energy demand in cities can be achieved by change in urban form favoring even more important shift from private vehicles to public transport and reuse of waste heat. In addition, mitigation actions in cities often provide multiple co-benefits. Though reinforcement of electricity interconnection is taken into account as an option in the scenario analysis, relocation of industrial firms would contribute to more effective use of heat from renewable sources and waste heat. Especially, at present most of the low temperature heat is disposed of. Though the locations of various industries and locations between industries and residential areas are well organized, there is a potential to improve energy efficiency and utilization of heat by reorganizing the locations, thereby further reducing CO2 emissions. Deep decarbonization in Japan requires a large scale transformation in the energy system. In particular, there is a huge challenge to integrate VRE, such as solar PV and wind power, into the electricity system. Additional plants that can provide flexibility, such as pumped hydro storage, are built to complement large-scale deployment of VREs in the scenario analysis. In addition, demand side management would 119 be an effective option but may not be implemented by a market mechanism alone, therefore, additional policy instruments such as dynamic pricing of electricity would be needed. The pace of deploying low-carbon technology is strongly influenced by public acceptance. In general, higher discount rates provide further opportunity to diffuse low-carbon technologies. Public acceptance of technologies may also involve social issues as well as economic barriers, because there are a wide range of possible co-benefits and adverse side effects that can be caused by diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Some infrastructures such as power plants and buildings entail considerable lock-in risks because the majority of those introduced in the near term would remain in 2050. As some gas combined-cycle plants as well as coal plants have to be equipped with CCS in 2050, newly built plants should be CCS-ready in addition to the introduction of the best available technology. After the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, electricity use had been reduced in order to avoid blackouts due to the Fukushima accident and the suspension of other damaged power plants. Continuing these actions could be helpful for deep decarbonization. Since 2011, fossil fuel import values have increased in Japan due to the rise in global crude oil price, the depreciation of Japanese Yen, and the suspension of nuclear plants. Immediate actions for deep decarbonization that decrease fossil fuel demand can contribute to reducing the impact on the economy in the near term. 120 GHG emissions in Mexico are rising due to an increasing use of fossil fuels. As the population slowly stabilizes (projected to be 151 million by 2050)1 and continued economic growth is expected, it is crucial to design a deep decarbonization strategy before new infrastructure is built. Many actions to mitigate climate change have valuable co-benefits (local health improvement, economic savings, and greater productivity, among others), and some are also linked to poverty reduction and social inclusion (for example food and energy security). Proven reserves of oil in Mexico are estimated to be around 1,340 million tons of oil equivalent (toe), while gas reserves represent an additional 430 million toe.2 The national energy reform approved recently is expected to boost investments in oil and gas production. Electricity generation is mainly produced from natural gas (50%), oil (11%), hydro (15%), and coal (13%); energy-intensive industry accounts for 23% of GDP. Urban population reached 72% in 2010, and it is expected to be close to 83% by 2030. Around 98% of households have access to electricity to date, and there are 210 vehicles per 1,000 people. In some rural areas, wood is still used as the main fuel for heating and cooking. The majority of future economic growth is expected to be driven by tertiary activities (services), which could account for nearly 70% of national GDP by 2050; in 2010 they represented around 60% of the total GDP. As this sector is less intensive both in energy and in CO2 than other economic activities in Mexico, this shift is expected to decrease GHG emissions. As GDP per capita increases, medium-sized cities are expected to grow. Historic trends show that urban centers expand in patterns that increase energy consumption and land use change. Smart urban development has been identified as a key way to transition towards more efficient and sustainable green growth schemes in Mexico. 1 Comisin Nacional de Poblacin (CONAPO), at: http://www.conapo.gob.mx 2 Data reported for January 2014. SENER, 2014, at: http://egob2.energia.gob.mx/SNIH/Reportes/Portal.swf?ProgGuid=FCAF8F9D-21D6-4661-98B5- 55D84B9C1D85 121 Total GHG emissions in Mexico reached 748 MtCO2e in 2010.3 The largest source of emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels (56%), and the greatest contributors to this category are the transport sector and electricity generation (Figure 1). Historically, GHG emissions in Mexico have been driven by increases in both population and in GDP per capita (Figure 2a).4 Energy use per capita has increased as well, at an average rate of about 1% per year between 1995 and 2010. 3 Inventario Nacional de Emisiones de Gases de Efecto Invernadero 1990-2010, INECC-SEMARNAT, 2013. 4 GDP increased 28% from 1995 to 2000 causing final energy per dollar of GDP to decrease noticeably in the same period. The significant increase in GDP reflects a recovery from the economic crisis of 1995, so only a limited amount of information can be gained from an examination of the 1995 to 2000 time period. 122 Total energy consumption reached around 176 million toe in 2010, including all consumption by final users (transport, industry, buildings), energy industries, and transmission losses.5 The distribution of final energy use was spread over the following fuels: gasoline (32%), electricity (16%), diesel (16%), natural gas (11%), LPG (10%), and wood (5%). Approximately 30% of all energy use is dedicated to transportation, and close to 70% of that energy is consumed by passenger transport alone. This trend reflects the increase in vehicle ownership, which doubled from 2000 to 2010 to approximately 207 vehicles per thousand people. This increased ownership and use has caused GHG emissions from the transport sector to increase at an annual rate of 3.2% between 1990 and 2010. The illustrative deep decarbonization scenario described in this report has been devised to achieve reductions of CO2 emissions as a result of changes in energy use and production towards less emission-intensive alternatives. As shown in Table 1, this analysis assumes a GDP growth rate of approximately 3% every year,6 from around 950 billion USD (at 2008 prices) in 2010 to some 3,100 billion USD in 2050.GDP per capita would reach approximately $20,425 USD/person by 2050. Table 1. Development Indicators and Energy Service Demand Drivers 2040 2010 2050 Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/capita] 2020 2030 113 127 137 145 151 8,339 9,987 12,407 15,764 20,425 Much of projected reduction in CO2 emissions across sectors relies on reducing the carbon intensity of electricity generation coupled with a switch from the combustion of fossil fuels to use of electricity in those final uses of energy where it is possible to do so. Although some assumptions were made regarding the future energy consumption of some appliances, the deep decarbonization scenario modeled does not include the effects of dedicated schemes to accelerate improvement of energy efficiency faster than historical trends. Non-electric fuel switches include a shift to natural gas from petroleum coke, coking coal, diesel, and residual fuel oil used in industry, as well as partial use of ethanol, natural gas, and biodiesel in transport to reduce gasoline and diesel consumption. This exploratory deep decarbonization scenario to 2050 assumes that primary energy systems in Mexico migrate from a heavy dependence on oil to pipeline gas, renewables, and nuclear power and that end-use energy will be provided mainly by electricity and natural gas (Figure 3). However, it is 5 Balance Nacional de Energa, Sistema de Informacin Energtica, SENER, 2014. 6 Official estimates for annual GDP growth in 2014 have been recently adjusted from 3.1% to 2.8% (Banco de Mxico, communiqu: http://www.banxico.org.mx/informacion-para-la-prensa/comunicados/resultados-de- encuestas/expectativas-de-los-especialistas/%7BB22F53FD-4129-ECE1-85E3-BCA42D652B16%7D.pdf). In this study we assume 3% annual growth as illustrative of a modest constant growth in the long term. 123 important to emphasize that a number of factors make it impossible to anticipate what specific technology choices will be made in Mexico, including the fact that the country is undergoing a major reform of its energy sector, which will affect regulation, planning, and the presence of private sector providers. As a result, this scenario in no way represents an expected or recommended pathway, and is neither government policy nor an official document of planning or intent. It merely seeks to lay out what a potential scenario could look like, in order to explore possible interplays between technologies and their feasibility considerations. This deep decarbonization scenario shows a substantial (96%) reduction in the GHG emissions released per unit of energy produced from 2010 and 2050 (Figure 4). Energy intensity of GDP also decreases, at a less aggressive rate of 2% each year to yield an overall reduction of 55% from 2010 to 2050. Finally, there is a substantial increase in the share of electricity in final energy use from 17% in 2010 to 46% by 2050. 124 The scenario assumes drastic reductions in the GHG emissions from electricity generation and transportation and lower reductions in buildings when comparing emission levels from 2050 to 2010 (Figure 5). The prominent role of electrification as a decarbonization strategy prioritizes a reduction of GHG emissions intensity in the electricity generation sector. In 2010, electricity generation was associated with a CO2 emissions intensity of 538 gCO2 per kWh. Results of an initial analysis show that in order to be consistent with the deep decarbonization objective, carbon intensity would need to fall to around 20 gCO2 per kWh by 2050. To accomplish this, the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario assumes electricity in Mexico will be generated from a larger share of renewables (especially solar), and natural gas with CCS. The additional electrical power required to enable the electrification of energy demand is substantial at nearly 1,100 TWh by 2050. To meet this electricity generation need, the full potential for renewable energy resources identified to date has been taken into account7, which includes 6,500 TWh/year of solar, 88 TWh/year of wind, 77 TWh/year of geothermal, 70 TWh/year of hydro,8 and 11 TWh/year of biomass. . Assuming that technological advances make it feasible to incorporate high levels of intermittency into the grid by 2050 (by developing energy storage capabilities, for example) a balanced mix was composed with the two main energy sources: solar (40%) and natural gas (35%). It is assumed that the rest of the supply is provided by wind (11%), hydro (6%), geothermal (2%), coal (2%), oil (2%) and nuclear (1%). Electricity generation from all fossil fuels (450 TWh) will require CCS in all generation plants (+60 GW) to comply with the stringent CO2 emission intensity discussed above. Such a 7 Inventario Nacional de Energas Renovables, SENER, 2014, in http://iner.energia.gob.mx/publica/version2.0/ 8 Includes estimates for large and small scale hydropower. 125 generation mix would have a share of intermittent renewable power of 51%9 and an average emission factor of only 19 g of CO2 per kWh produced (Figure 6). Under the deep decarbonization scenario illustrated here, final energy consumption would amount to approximately 200 million toe by 2050 (from industry, transport, and buildings). In this exercise, the reduction in carbon intensity of the industrial activity is achieved by the massive substitution of oil products (residual fuel oil, coke and, diesel) by largely decarbonized electricity (to around 55% of energy demand projected by 2050) and natural gas (35%). The resulting carbon intensity after such measures would be about two-thirds less than it is today (Figure 7a). Due to the low energy requirements in households and Mexicos relatively mild weather, GHG emissions from buildings (residential and commercial sectors) have not historically been increasing at high rates. However, steps must be taken to ensure household energy consumption does not emulate North American trends. To reduce the building-related direct energy emissions, the scenario explores the substitution of gas (both LPG and natural gas) by electricity in final energy uses (figure 7b). 9 Hydro power is considered as part of intermittent technologies for two reasons: highly variable mini-hydro 126 In the transport sector, a massive fuel shift from gasoline and diesel to electricity and natural gas has been considered as an illustrative decarbonization approach (Figure 7c and Figure 8), using three exploratory assumptions: 1) A passenger modal shift to mass-public electric transportation systems to satisfy the increasing travel demand; 2) Freight shift to electric trains and gas powered trucks; and 3) 60% of light vehicles (private cars and taxis) would switch to electricity, and 65% of freight would switch to natural gas and biodiesel by 2050. Note: Carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. potential is an important part of future potential and the vulnerability of hydrologic systems to climate change. 127 The preliminary deep decarbonization scenario outlined in this report relies heavily on the complementarity between the electrification of energy usage across sectors and the simultaneous abatement of GHG emissions in the power sector. In order to do this the implementation of large infrastructure and investments for clean energy are required. In this scenario, we have emphasized the role of solar energy, together with extensive use of CCS techniques at gas power plants. Achieving this very ambitious solar target (260 TWh/year, assuming a capacity factor of 20%) requires an aggressive cost reduction strategy that allows massive roll-out of said technology, both as dedicated solar power plants feeding the grid, as well as distributed production for households and industries, and investment in transmission lines. Further advances in energy storage technology and smart grids will also be required to integrate so much intermittent resource into the grid, and would help limit demand on the grid and the need for even more generation and transmission infrastructure. Given the large share of gas-fueled electricity projected in this scenario, Mexico would need the potential capacity to store approximately 200 million tons of CO2 every year. A theoretical storage potential of 100 GtCO2 has been identified in a preliminary study.10 Increasing the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources other than solar would require further exploration and technological development to exploit lower-yield potentials in wind, geothermal, and biomass resources. The preliminary approach followed to deeply decarbonize the transport sector assumes the feasibility of implementation of extensive electric inter-modal mass transport systems. For this to be true at the required scale it would be necessary to change the present urban growth patterns. Todays medium- sized cities are expected to drive most of the future growth and would need to adopt and enforce best smart growth practices. This scenario also assumed that by 2050 electric vehicles will be widely available, and that it will be possible to divert freight from the road to electric trains without major technical issues. 10 The North American Carbon Storage Atlas (NACSA), 1st Edition, 2012. www.nacsap.org 128 Given the dependence of this approach on the decarbonization of the electricity generation sector, it is important to explore alternative technological scenarios for this sector. In this analysis we assume the presence of competitive energy storage systems that enable grids to include a high share of intermittent sources (solar or wind power) and are valuable to manage overall demand. However, if such a solar plan is unfeasible, an alternative pathway must be devised, perhaps by increasing the share of nuclear power or natural gas with CCS. in the from measures considered illustrative deep The projected GHG emissions resulting decarbonization scenario could be further reduced by additional actions that have not been yet evaluated. Other options that have not been explored at full capacity in the present study and that may have interesting potential are: additional renewables (wind, geothermal, and marine power), industrial processes redesigned to decrease energy intensity and byproduct GHG emissions, large-scale CCS in industrial facilities, massive adoption of hybrid vehicles, large-scale production of bio-fuels for transport, and partially substituting the natural gas in the pipeline network with lower-carbon alternatives. Municipal and agricultural waste can be a source of biogas, rather than GHG emissions. Utilizing biogas from landfills and water treatment operations might help lower future consumption of natural gas for electricity generation. Major challenges that may deter realization of this scenario include current energy subsidies (both for fossil fuels and electricity), economic potential, lack of resources to fund the transition, and the technological availability of cost-effective options for CCS, electric vehicles, solar power harvesting, and biofuels production. Amongst the enabling conditions that require international cooperation, we identify technology development for energy storage and energy management (smart demand and smart grids), carbon taxes to imports and exports of fossil fuels, and the development of zero carbon or carbon negative agriculture and forestry techniques to support production of sustainable bioenergy crops and reduce emissions from these sectors. Although this is an initial exploration of deep decarbonization in Mexico, some conclusions can be drawn from the magnitude of the challenge at hand. Adoption of better practices in urbanization and territorial planning could prove crucial to lower future energy consumption per capita and simultaneously improve quality of life. Better-organized cities could induce the behavioral changes needed for mode shifts in transportation. 129 A robust low-carbon electricity generation policy is required to evaluate different future alternatives, increase certainty over governmental plans, and provide an economically feasible route for future development. Energy efficiency programs coupled with appropriate energy price signals could help decrease the financial burden of the transformation needed by reducing energy demand and thus reducing the amount of funds needed to transition towards a deep decarbonization development pathway. 130 With the largest territory of the world (17 billion km2, of which 67% are on permafrost), the Russian Federation has a very low population density (8.4 person per km2). It is endowed with large fossil fuel reserves representing 34% of world reserves of natural gas, 12% of crude oil, and 20% of coal. The energy sector is logically dominated by fossils fuels, which are importantly used for exports (around 40% of the 1.7 billion tons of coal equivalent (tce) extracted natural gas, coal, and crude oil is exported). The forest area covers 1.2 billion hectares, most of which is owned by the State (97%). The agricultural land occupies 220 mln hectares and is used mainly for plowing, crops, forage production, and livestock pastures. The total waste production is approximately 4 billion tons per year, less than half of which is utilized or treated. National production is structured around industrial production (30%), trade (19%), services (12%), transport and communication (8%), agriculture (4%), and construction (7%). An important characteristic of the industrial sector is the rather high overall depreciation of industrial capital. Since more than 80% of assets are more than 20 years old across all carbon-intensive industries and sectors, industrial modernization is one of the high priorities for the national government. Similarly, the overall capacity structure of the power generation sector is quite old, as the main investments were made in the 1960- 1980s, and almost all large units will exceed their expected service life and become obsolete in 10-20 years. Notably, in 2010, out of the 146GW thermal power and combined heat and power (CHP) plants, 91 GW were more than 30 years old, and 46 were more that 40 years old. Another important specificity over recent years is the intense rise of the transportation sector, notably for private cars which have reached 38.8 millions units or 257 cars per 1,000 people in 2013. The long-term strategic goals of economic development are stipulated in various official documents, such as the Concept of Socio-Economic Development by 2020,11 Energy strategy  2030,12 General 11http://www.economy.gov.ru/minec/activity/sections/strategicplanning/concept/ 131 Scheme of Electricity Units Allocation  2030,13 and others. The specific climate change mitigation policy objectives are provided in the Russian Climate Doctrine (2009),14 Presidential Decree On greenhouse gas emission reduction (2013)15 and its Implementation Plan adopted by Government (2014),16 as well as the sectoral and industrial plans and programs (e.g. the energy efficiency improvement program, environmental policy, forestry, agricultural, and many others). The main focus on longer-term development goals in Russia deals with the economic growth, diversification of the economy, modernization of its technological base and infrastructure, increase of the share of innovative, knowledge-based sectors, improvement of environmental quality, and population wellbeing. The long-term targets for carbon emissions by 2050 have not been identified as yet, and the deep decarbonization strategy is still to be developed and adopted by Russia. The structure of domestic energy consumption is centered on fossil fuels, where natural gas, coal, and petroleum represent respectively 52%, 12%, and 35% of total demand. Electricity generation is mainly based on thermal power plants (68% of total production), and major alternatives include hydropower with 15% and nuclear with 16%. The share of renewable sources is negligible (below 1% of total primary energy production). In 2011, Russias GHG emissions were dominated by CO2 emissions, contributing to 73% of total GHG emissions essentially from fossil fuel combustion, which account for 1,502 MtCO2e or 65% of total emissions (2011). Other major sources of emissions include fugitive emissions from the energy sector (418 MtCO2e, or 18%) and industrial processes (mineral products, chemical industry, metal production, production and consumption of halocarbons and SF6) (174 MtCO2e, or 8%). The agriculture, waste, solvent, and other product use jointly account for 225 MtCO2e (10%). Carbon sinks (forestry and land use) play an important role in Russian carbon balance and are also of high political concern due to perception of the national forest as a source of global ecological gift. In 2011, the net carbon sequestration (in managed forest) amounted to 624 MtCO2e, compensating 27% of total national GHG emissions. In this study, the main focus is on carbon emissions related to the Russian energy sector, covering primarily CO2 emissions from electricity generation, industries, transport, buildings, and other sources. The share of these sources is approximately two-thirds of total national emissions (Figure 1). Total GHG emissions in Russia decreased by 31% over 1990-2011, from 3,300 to 2,300 MtCO2e (Figure 2), caused by dramatic drop of industrial production after the collapse of USSR in 1991. The 1999-2011 period was remarkable for Russia as it demonstrated clear decoupling of economic growth and carbon emissions (only 17% increase of emission for 95% GDP increase). The main drivers of this evolution include economic growth, structural changes in the economy, technological changes (modernization), fuel switch from coal to gas, growth of energy prices, and corresponding energy saving. Less, but still 12http://minenergo.gov.ru/aboutminen/energostrategy/ 13http://minenergo.gov.ru/press/min_news/3915.html 14http://kremlin.ru/acts/6365 15http://kremlin.ru/acts/19344 16http://government.ru/media/files/41d4d0082f8b65aa993d.pdf 132 important factors for carbon emission dynamics include transport and infrastructure development, waste management, agricultural production, forest policy (reforestation, forest management), etc. The illustrative scenario discusses the technical feasibility of a low-carbon economic development under assumptions on economic growth (notably, increase of steel and cement production, as well as 133 increase of mobility) and patterns of development integrating a set of assumptions from official,17 independent, and experts visions and assumptions of Russian long-term economic development, technologies development reviews, and projections by the Russian and international organizations, as well as extensive expert consultations. Then the scenario of economic development is simulated with technological model RU-TIMES with a decarbonization target set up at 1.67 t of CO2 per capita in 2050. Uncertainties and robustness of conclusions are discussed in section 2c. Table 1. Selected assumptions and results about the socio-economic and energy sector development for the deep decarbonization scenario in Russia Population (millions) GDP per capita (constant 2012 US$) 13,116 19,127 2020 25,726 32,932 40,833 2010 2030 2040 2050 132 126 142 137 120 The scenario assumes a population decline from 142 to 120 million people in 2050 and the (almost) tripling of per capita GDP. The simulation of total primary energy supply (TPES) and final energy production are shown in Figure 2. The deep decarbonization results in a decline of TPES by 27% in 2050, with significant changes in the structure of energy production: total coal use drops to 2.8% (half of it with CCS); natural gas contributes 36% of TPES but almost half of it should use CCS; the share of oil should drop to 7.1%; renewables share including biomass rises to 32.5%; and the share of nuclear can reach 21.8%. The final energy consumption (from 538 Mtoe in 2010 to 428 Mtoe in 2050) in Russia should also be significantly transformed in the deep decarbonization scenario: coal use to be phased out to 1.6%; the share of gas to reach 23.5% of TPES; liquid fuel to decline to 9.1%; while the share of biomass should reach 11.9% of TPES and electricity and heat 53.9% by 2050. The scenario pinpoints a decline of energy-related CO2 emissions from 1,422 Mt in 2010 to 200 Mt in 2050. The share of renewables in energy balance moves up to 10% in 2050 (0% in 2010). The decomposition of energy-related CO2 emission drivers and its pillars show that the growth of GDP per capita drives CO2 emission up and is offset by the following emissions abating drivers:  The reduction of the use of primary energy per unit of GDP: the energy intensity of GDP must decline from 376 to 141 GJ/$;  The decarbonization of energy production: the carbon intensity of electricity generation should decline from 846 to 14 gCO2/kWh;  The electrification of the economy: the share of electricity in total final energy consumption should increase from 16% to 34%; and  A declining population. 17 Concept of the Long-Term Socio-Economic Development of Russian Federation (2008), Energy Strategy  2030, industrial and sectoral programs of development (electric power sector, transport, metallurgy and others), IEA Technology Perspectives (2010, 2012, 2014), and others. 134 135 The electric power sector is key in the decarbonization of the Russian economy. Electricity itself is a convenient, clean energy source that can be produced with zero- or very low-carbon technologies. The Russian electric power sector has 700 power and combined heat and power (CHP) plants (over 5 MW of capacity). The total installed capacity accounts for 223 GW (in 2012), of which zero-emission capacities include 46 GW of hydro and 23 GW of nuclear power plants. The rest is covered by natural gas and coal-fired power plants. The forthcoming retirement, made necessary by the obsolescence of the majority of fossil-based power stations, creates both opportunities and challenges for the industry. The modernization will improve energy efficiency of the sector, which is far below best available technological options. The excessive capacities and slowly-growing demand limit opportunities for investment in the industry. There are several strategies possible to decarbonize the power industry, including growth of nuclear and hydropower (already planned by the industry) and growth of renewables share in the energy mix. However, with assumed CCS availability, the significant expansion to meet the low-carbon target will be required only after 2040. The CCS technologies are assumed to be commercially available, and they will play an important role in the decarbonization strategy in the power sector in Russia beyond 2030. Almost all remaining thermal power plants (coal and natural gas fired) need to be equipped with CCS technology by 2050 to reach the deep decarbonization target (Figure 6). 136 It is expected that the recent trends of fast-growing mobility demand continues, leading to a 100-150% rise of passenger transportation by 2050 and an increase of light duty vehicles (LDV) and air transport. The reasons for this growth include growing GDP per capita, expansion of the loan market, and a shift from public transport to private light duty vehicles (LDVs). The low-carbon technological options in the LDV sector include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) engines in the mid-term and expansion of biofuel use in the long run with updating LDV to the best available technologies. The electric vehicles will likely meet delayed expansion in Russia due to tough (cold) climate conditions, unless the technology improves Plug-in hybrids with internal combustion engines on LPG or biofuel may be more competitive. Another challenge is limiting emissions from air transportation, which will notably be permitted by the introduction of biofuels. The freight transportation (rise from 2,119 bln t*km to 3,608 bln t*km in 2050) can be decarbonized at relatively low costs. The heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) could use LPG and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in medium-term. In the long-term, biofuels would be the primary option. 137 The biggest polluter in transport sector will be pipeline transport. There seem to be no alternative to the use of natural gas as fuel to transport natural gas via pipelines. So the amounts of consumed natural gas will be defined by the domestic natural gas consumption and exports via pipelines. With all the decarbonization measures applied, emissions of the transport sector in 2050 can reach 36.6 MtCO2e (Figures 7c). In final energy consumption, the share of electricity will move up from 7% in 2010 to 28% in 2050, with fall of oil products from 93% in 2010 to 8%, and increase of biofuels up to 44%. Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. The residential buildings in Russia contain huge potential for energy efficiency improvements. The heating system in Russia is historically highly centralized, with around 75% of heat being supplied by district boiler houses and combined heat and power boilers (CHPs). The overall depreciation of the heat supply system is over 50%. The considered scenario assumes 30% growth of living space area per person, from 23 m2 per capita to 30 m2 per capita in 2050, as a catch-up with average living space per person for European countries (which is around 35-45 m2 per capita). The decline of population over 2010-2050 however limits the expansion of total residential surface. The deep decarbonization pathway requires tapping the existing reserves in energy efficiency improvement of buildings and overall residential heating systems. The scenario assumes a drop in energy consumption of buildings by 6 times to the level of 60 kWh per m2 by 2050 (this is still a 138 conservative estimate, compared to the best practice estimated around 15 kWh/ m2 per year). The fuel mix structure should also be significantly changed with notable increases in biomass, electrification, and wide use of geo-heat pumps for heating. The commercial and residential buildings have to follow the same strategy of energy efficiency growth, with additional electrification where possible and reduction of fossil energy consumption. Figure 7b shows total energy balance of the residential and commercial sectors, consistent with the deep decarbonization target. Industrial output of energy intensive industries (iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals and petrochemicals, mining, and cement) is assumed to grow up to 26% over the next four decades (steel production rises from 66 Mt to 83 Mt and cement from 49 Mt to 69 Mt), and 10% in other energy intensive industries. Important energy efficiency gains and changes in the energy mix are then necessary to make this significant growth compatible with limitations of associated emissions. The largest energy consumer in industry is integrated iron and steel (IIS) production. Since 1990, the IIS industry showed significant energy efficiency improvement that resulted in more than 20% reduction in carbon intensity of steel production due to retrofit and replacement of fixed capital. Further improvement, as expected, will lead to 35% additional energy efficiency, mainly due to the adoption of blast-furnace gas recycling technologies, which will increase carbon intensity of the steel production to EU level. However, for deeper reductions, further energy efficiency improvement technologies should be considered, such as direct reduced iron (DRI) on natural gas with potential to reduce CO2 emissions up to 20-30% (with decarbonized electricity). Processes of other energy-intensive industries are very diverse, and a moderate decarbonization potential of the remaining industries is considered, mainly by means of electrification of the industries from 14% to 34%, and a 6% energy efficiency growth from 2010 to 2050. The total fuel mix structure of industry and other remaining sectors (agriculture, forestry, fishing) consistent with the deep decarbonization scenario is presented in Figure 7a. The land use and forestry sector (LULUCF) is a very important source of carbon emissions and abatement in Russia. Since 1990, the net carbon sequestration in LULUCF increased up to 628 MtCO2 due to relatively low levels of logging, low shares of over-matured wood, and other factors. However, the carbon net sink in Russian forests is expected to decline, and the net sink will become negative (emissions will exceed sequestration) by the mid-2040s18 due to an increasing share of over-matured forest, expansion of forest fires and diseases, insufficient adaptation policies and measures, etc. In order to keep and enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of Russian forests, as a large source of CO2 absorption from the atmosphere, substantial enhancement and strengthening of climate change policy in the forest sector is required, including international cooperation in scientific, forest monitoring, forest fire and disease control measures, investment, and technological support. 18http://unfccc.int/files/national_reports/annex_i_natcom/submitted_natcom/application/pdf/6nc_rus_final.pdf 139 The major technological conditions for reaching deep decarbonization in Russia include: 1) Pursue aggressive end use efficiency across all sectors; 2) Electrify where possible, and use gas where not possible to electrify; 3) Decarbonize the power sector by increasing the use of renewables, nuclear, hydropower plants, and maximize efficiency of thermal power and CHP plants; 4) Methane leakage, especially in extraction, storage, and transportation of natural gas is not covered by the scenario but will require substantial reduction; 5) Deep decarbonization of industrial production (e.g. metallurgy, cement, chemicals, and other); 6) Decarbonization of transport sector via electrification, biofuel use, etc.; 7) Energy efficiency improvement of all type of buildings; 8) Use of carbon capture and storage (CCS); 9) Utilization of huge biomass fuel potential, as well as other renewable energy sources; and 10) Large-scale heat production using heat pumps and energy saving in residential and commercial sectors. The most critical technological assumption in the analysis is CCS availability, biofuels potential, and scope of application of geothermal heat pumps for district heating. Although CCS has been tested in pilot projects around the world, the technology is not commercial yet, and it is uncertain if it will be available under competitive costs in Russia. With significant resources of biomass, costs and feasibility of biofuels production depend on many factors, including location, type of bio-resource, process of development, and competitiveness of the technology. In case one of these technological assumptions cannot be realized, alternative low-carbon strategies should be considered. If CCS is not available, renewables might be used instead. He current scenario is quite conservative for renewable energy in electricity production (about 25% in total generation) versus other countries, where renewable energy may reach more than 80%. Though Russia has relatively lower potential for mainstream solar and wind power, there is more than significant potential of tidal and hydro energy. A higher share of nuclear power is another alternative. Electrification of transport can be an alternative to biofuels. Higher energy efficiency improvements of buildings can reduce demand for heat and geo-heat pumps. Though the discussed scenario already has an ambitious target, additional measures could be envisaged to trigger deeper emission reductions notably through further electrification of industry, transport, final use sectors, and energy efficiency improvement. In particular, under specific conditions to be investigated more precisely, the following measures could be envisaged:  Maximizing production of renewable electricity, harvesting tidal energy, hydro-power;  Maximizing energy efficiency of buildings;  Application of CCS in industry, including cement and iron and steel; 140  Combination of biomass energy with CCS;  Hydrogen-based technologies where possible, including transportation and steel production; and  Optimizing public transportation, reducing number of trips, switching from private cars to public transport, and from air-transport to trains. The deep decarbonization of Russian economy will require significant efforts from government, businesses, and citizens. Rearrangement of the national economy in favor of low-carbon production technologies and a much less traditional use of fossil fuels will require dramatic changes in strategic planning, technological innovations, environmental regulation, low-carbon energy production technologies, relevant transport standards and infrastructure, household behavioral changes and, certainly, strong political will. Evidently, Russia has an enormous potential for deep decarbonization. It has the necessary natural capital and territory, technological and scientific potential, and financial resources. The biggest challenge though is to channel the political will and business efforts towards the deep decarbonization pathway. In the current context, when the major share of Russias industrial capital assets are depreciated and require renovation and modernization, it is a great opportunity for starting the new capital investment cycle based on the deep decarbonization platform. Russia can also play a significant role in exporting clean (carbon free) energy and products to neighboring countries, based on the implementation of large-scale projects on tidal energy generation in the North-West and Far East of Russia (with unique natural conditions), production of the second generation liquid and solid biofuels. The competitiveness of the new types of energy will be unlocked by emission reduction targets around the world. Obviously, the international decarbonization regime would play an extremely important role in Russias mitigation efforts, both in terms of scale and speed of changes required. Involvement of Russia in international initiatives would be crucial, including technological cooperation, implementation of investment projects (e.g. using Russian renewable energy sources, new generation nuclear power projects, etc.), global carbon pricing mechanisms, forest carbon sequestration and adaptation mechanisms (LULUCF, REDD+), scientific research on low-carbon development, etc. These long-term cooperation frameworks need to be provided in the new climate change agreement with active participation of all major-emitting countries, as well as other international agreements under the UN, WTO, and others. Near-term priorities for the Russian deep decarbonization pathway should include:  Establishment of the information basis for emission management (monitoring, verification, and reporting on the source level); 141  Development and introduction of the GHG emission regulation system (providing incentives for emission reduction, project-based, cap-and-trade schemes, etc.);  Strengthening the current decarbonization efforts (gasification programs, energy efficiency, renewable energy use, energy saving, decarbonization of transport, cement, chemical, metal production, etc.);  Enhancing R&D in and implementation of breakthrough technologies (e.g. biofuels,  electrification of transport and infrastructure, CCS, new generation nuclear power plants, etc.); and Improvement of the adaptation/mitigation policies and measures in forestry and agriculture, supporting carbon sequestration capacities. These efforts will allow continuing decoupling GDP growth and GHG emission trends and will facilitate finding new solutions to deep decarbonization in Russia. Partly, these measures correspond to the activities approved in the Governmental Action Plan on reduction of GHG emissions (adopted on February 4, 2014) and other decisions. However, the deep decarbonization approach will require significant adjustments in strategic planning of the economic development, technological, and institutional changes aimed at the creation of climate-neutral Russia. 142 The African Climate Change Response White Paper (DEA 2011) states, South Africa is committed to contributing its fair share to global GHG mitigation efforts in order to keep the temperature increase well below 2C. With financial, technology, and capacity-building support, this level of effort will enable South Africas GHG emissions to peak between 2020 and 2025 in a range with a lower limit of 398 MtCO2eq and upper limits of 583 MtCO2eq and 614 MtCO2eq for 2020 and 2025 respectively, plateau with a lower limit of 398 MtCO2eq and upper limit of 614 MtCO2eq for approximately a decade, and decline in absolute terms thereafter to a range with lower limit of 212 MtCO2eq and upper limit of 428 MtCO2eq. This is referred to as the Peak Plateau Decline (PPD) benchmark trajectory. South Africa has a modern urban economy, with an advanced service sector and a large energy- intensive industrial base, dependent on huge mineral resources. There are high levels of inequality and poverty, given that society is divided along spatial, economic, and social lines established in colonial and then Apartheid eras (South Africa, 2013a):  The top decile of the population accounts for 58% of income while the bottom half accounts for less than 8% (World Bank 2013), resulting in one of the highest inequality levels of the world as indicated by a Gini coefficient of 0.69.  45% of the population lives under the upper-bound poverty level (R706 [66.36 US$] per month in 2009 prices). Unemployment is also a major, related concern. The unemployment rate reaches 25.5% according to standard definitions (40% when including discouraged work seekers [Gumede, 2013]); this is the highest rate out of 40 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg (Bloomberg, 2014). These issues are acknowledged in key policy documents, namely the National Development Plan (NDP) and the New Growth Path (NGP), and they are highly relevant in economic policies related to GHG emissions mitigation. Social grants were extended to 14.8m people in 2011, an increase from 3.8m in 2001 (Gumede, 2013), but relying on grants is not sustainable and substantial socio-economic development is required to address poverty, inequality, and unemployment. The population of South Africa was some 52m in 2011, is 60% urbanized, and grew 21% between the 1996-2011 censuses. South Africa will need to make provisions for the projected 8m new urban residents by 2030. Of 10m households, 3m remain without electricity connections. 143 The average GDP growth of 3.5% over the past decade has not been associated with a significant increase in employment. The NDP envisages an average GDP growth of 5.4% until 2030 (NPC, 2011), and the NGP states that GDP growth between 4-7% is necessary (South Africa, 2011a) to meet development objectives. The shift in the twentieth century of the South African economy from primarily a rural, agricultural economy to an urban, industrial one was initially based on mining and then transitioned to energy- intensive minerals-based industrialization, with the energy supply primarily based on coal and imported crude oil. The structure of the economy has evolved from a tertiary sector accounting for 57% of total GDP in 1984 to 70% today. There are important linkages between the tertiary sector and the minerals-based components of the primary and secondary sectors, and the economy relies on the primary and secondary sectors for much foreign direct investment and 60% of foreign exchange export earnings. South Africas recoverable coal reserves amount to approximately 49,000 Mt, giving the country the world's sixth-largest coal reserves (SACRM, 2013) and a reserve/production ratio of more than 200 years. Fluri (2009) estimates 548 GW of potential for concentrated solar power (CSP). Hageman (2013) estimates wind potential at 56 GW, 157 TWh p.a. There is a large regional hydro potential, greater than 40 GW.19 The NDP recognizes that the South African economy is highly energy and (mineral) resource-intensive but states: a resource-intensive development path is unsustainable (NPC 2011). This is at odds with parts of the Industrial Policy Action Plan 2013-2016 (South African Department of Trade and Industry, 2013), the Beneficiation Strategy in the NGP and the current Integrated Resource Plan (DOE, 2013), which all envisage strong growth in the resource-intensive sectors and labor absorbing industrialization (South Africa, 2011a). 20 GHG emissions in 2010 were around 543 MtCO2eq, 78% of which were from fossil fuel combustion, amounting to 10 t/cap. This high level is the combined result of an energy and electricity-intensive economy, since 95% of electricity is generated from coal and about 35% of liquid fuels are manufactured from coal (coal to liquids, CTL). 19 This would require construction of regional transmission lines but projects are already under development and official planning (DOE 2013) includes Grand Inga in the Democratic Republic of Congo some 3000km from SA and other research reports indicate firm resource availability see IRENA 2013. 20 Most energy-related figures in this chapter, including energy GHG emissions, are estimated based on: (i) DOE 2006 statistics (DOE 2009) which are the latest available official statistics covering all energy sub- sectors and related time series from 1992-2006; (ii) Eskom statistics published in the Eskom annual report; and (iii) where public data is not available, estimates are made based on work by the Energy Research Centre (ERC) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) related to the SATIM energy and emissions model. see http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/Research/esystems-group-satim.htm 144 Of 250 Mt coal mined annually, 44% is for electricity generation, 28% exported, 18% for CTL, and 10% used directly. Of the 10% used directly, 65% is used in industry, 23% in households, and 12% in commerce (DOE, 2009). Note: The other category includes both energy and process emissions of South Africas unique coal to liquids plants. Note: Sector specific data for 1990 and 1995 were not available for this report.21 In 2010, industry, residences, and commercial buildings accounted for 60%, 20%, and 15% of electricity demand respectively. Electricity consumption grew steadily for decades until 2007 when a supply constraint, which is still at work, arose. Electricity prices have more than doubled in real terms and are set to double again by 2015. Two large coal-fired power stations totaling 9.6 GW, equivalent to 21 South Africa did develop GHG inventories for the years 1990, 1994 and 2000. However, between them there are wide variations in methodologies and results and the 1990 and 1994 versions do not have sufficiently detailed supporting information to resolve the variations to derive sufficiently meaningful trends for DDDP purposes. The 2010 inventory has been released for comment in June 2014 and is therefore not final. 145 some 25% of currently installed capacity, are under construction. More than 3 GW of low-carbon electricity generation, mainly utility scale wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), and concentrated solar (CSP), are also being contracted or under construction. The South African Illustrative DDP is based on an economy that prioritizes meeting socio-economic development needs in terms of adequate income levels and income distribution and providing energy services for South African residents, business, and industry. This is done while retaining the GDP structure of the economy and configuring an energy supply and end-use system that is consistent with the PPD. The GDP structure is retained to provide products such as steel and cement crucial for development and to maintain the macro-economic stability provided by investments in and foreign exchange contributions of the minerals and industrial sectors. These assumptions are discussed in section 2.2. In the illustrative scenario, the economy has average GDP growth of some 4%, which is consistent with the low end of the range of the NDP and NGP. Over 2010-2050, there is an improvement in income distribution, and by 2050 there are no households with low incomes (below R19,200 [around 1,800 US$]). Meaningful employment impacts could not be estimated. Table 1. Development Indicators and Energy Service Demand Drivers Population [Millions] GDP per capita [$/cap] Electrification rate [%houses connected] Household income distribution [m residents] Low Income (R0 - R19,200) Middle Income (R19,201 - R76,800) High Income (R76,801 and above) 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 50 5,052 58 6,355 67 8,008 69 11,411 70 16,339 81% 90% 95% 97% 100% 24 15 11 14 32 12 9 39 19 5 34 29 0 27 44 Energy end-use demand per sector for the illustrative economy is used as input to the ERCs TIMES model of the South African energy system (SATIM)22 using a cumulative energy emissions constraint over 2010-2050 of 14 GtCO2eq. This is consistent with cumulative emissions of the median of the PPD trajectory, achieving the same cumulative emissions but a higher end level. A technically feasible energy system for the DDP is achieved with a 2050 level of energy emissions of 257 MtCO2eq. There is a large 22 For details of the SATIM modeling framework and methodology, see http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/Research/esystems- group-satim.htm. 146 increase in end-use energy required for the illustrative economy with a net decrease in primary energy over 2010-2050 and a significant decrease in primary energy per GDP. Electricity sector emissions reduce radically, emissions from buildings halve, and emissions from industry increase threefold. Transport emissions remain relatively constant. The other sector (in Figure 1), which is largely CTL, is phased out. 147 148 Electricity generation increases threefold. Electricity generation emissions decrease from 880g/kWh in 2010 to 20g/kWh in 2050, mainly through the replacement of coal-fired generation with CSP with storage and construction of significant additional CSP, nuclear, and widespread rooftop PV. With South Africas solar radiation resource, the extensive use of CSP with storage and PV across a wide geographic spread combined with some dispatchable generating assets provides a system with satisfactory loss-of-load probability. Liquid fuels production emissions intensity is radically reduced through phasing out of CTL, and by 2050 all liquid fuels are produced locally from crude oil. The industrial sector remains a constant proportional contribution to GDP, and it significantly expands at some 4% p.a. along with the rest of GDP, which leads to a significant increase in energy demand. Concurrent decreases in total emissions attributable to industry (i.e. direct and induced emissions) are achieved through fuel switching from coal to gas, improvements in efficiency of end-use technologies, and shifting to electricity for some thermal applications. Supply of significant additional passenger transport from 285 bn p-km to 509 bn p-km, a per capita increase from 5,724 km/cap to 7,233 km/cap, meets basic development objectives. Private vehicle transport increases from 2,669 km/cap to 3,861 km/cap and public transport from 3,055 km/cap to 3,327 km/cap. Public transport involves a significant shift from mini-bus taxi (MBT) to Bus-Rapid- Transit (BRT) and rail, which are far safer and more comfortable. The number of private vehicles doubles from 5m to 10m (9 people/vehicle to 6.5 people/vehicle). Passenger transportation achieves a large increase in supply combined with a small decrease (from 31 Mt-29 Mt CO2eq, 2010-2050) in emissions through a combination of modal shift and vehicle efficiency improvements. The emissions intensity of private transport improves from 160 to 59 gCO2/p- km. The Illustrative DDP has a low 5% level of electric private vehicles, but by 2040 around 19% of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles introduced are electric and 25% compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered, increasing to 50% by 2050. Jet air transport emissions nearly double over the 2010-2050 period and remain largely un-mitigated as standard fossil fuels are used. There is no shift to high-speed inter-city rail. More than 90% of freight is carried by heavy commercial vehicles (HCV) or rail in 2050 with export of minerals and beneficiated minerals accounting for 20%; thus heavy haulage dominates. 149 Freight transport demand derives from sectoral GDP growth and related transport requirements and increases from 292 bn t-km to 998 bn t-km (~240%) with an increase of 342 PJ to 492 PJ in energy and 24 Mt to 32 Mt in emissions. The large increase in transport supply combined with the proportionally smaller increase in emissions is achieved mainly through a combination of modal shift and vehicle efficiency improvements: a shift from HCV to rail and improvement in HCV fuel economy from 39.1 to 16.6 l/100km. All rail is electrified. Average freight emissions intensities improve from 83 to 32 tCO2/t km. Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. If biomass is sustainably harvested and paraffin is replaced with biofuels, the liquid fuels and solid biomass components in figure 7b reduce to zero, and the South African building sector contributes a negligible amount to GHG emissions in 2050 because all other energy services are supplied with very low-carbon electricity. Of some 10m households, 3m remain without electricity connections in 2010, but Tait and Winkler (2012) show that providing adequate electricity for poor households in the medium term will not contribute significantly to emissions associated with coal-fired electricity in comparison with the emissions from other sectors. South African climatic conditions allow for provision of adequate energy services with little energy on average (<1000kW p.a.) required for home space heating and cooling. 60% of water heating (currently largest single household energy component accounting for 50% of mid-income households) can be provided with solar water heaters and with very efficient lighting and electronic technologies that are already commercially available, cooking becomes the largest electricity 150 energy service at around 5,000 kWh p.a. Thus, with adequate thermal performance, an additional 6m households could require only some 36 TWh p.a., less than 5% of total demand in 2010. The central assumption used in formulating the Illustrative DDP for South African is that it is based on known resources and technologies currently deployed commercially although by 2050 industrial end- use technologies are assumed to improve significantly in efficiency beyond current available levels. Achieving the required 14 GtCO2eq cumulative emissions, while maintaining a feasible energy supply to industry as per economic development assumptions requires early retirement of coal-fired electricity generation and deployment of low-carbon technologies to meet additional demand. The specific configuration in the Illustrative DDP, with 80% CSP, is one of many very different but equivalently feasible configurations that could provide similar performance; South Africa has excellent low-carbon natural energy resources. Generic assumptions were made regarding end-use technology per major sub-sector: steady rates of improvement in end-use technologies were implemented, as were rates for switching from coal to gas technologies, with limits for totals. This conservative approach has been taken in the absence of detailed plant and end-use technology inventories. The rates and limits are considered to be conservative. For example, improvements made in the iron and steel sector, which increases its production from 10 Mt p.a. to 47 Mt p.a. from 2010-2050, achieve an intensity of 0.83 MtCO2eq/Mt by 2050. This is at the top end of the range of the international benchmark range of 0.47-0.84 tCO2eq/t. Switching from coal to gas is an essential component to decarbonize industry. Although South Africa does not currently have significant gas resources or the required capacity for gas importation, transmission, and distribution, it is assumed that it is technically feasible for this to be provided. Efficiencies across the range of small-medium passenger vehicles increase by between 50-60% from 2010-2050. Gasoline and diesel vehicles improve from 9.0 to 4.0 and 7.5 to 3.2 l/100km respectively, and diesel MBT improve from 11.3 to 5.5 l/100km. It is assumed that 5% passenger vehicle sales are EVs in 2050. The central assumption used in formulating the Illustrative DDP for South African is that it is based on known resources and technologies deployed at commercial scale. 151 The electricity decarbonization relies heavily on CSP with storage. There is a more than adequate solar resource. CSP technology is already operating at scale (NREL 2014), and bids have been accepted by the South African government for supply of a Power Purchase Agreement for the Bokpoort 50 MW station with storage which is already under construction. Thus, from a technical point of view CSP should be a robust solution. However, should CSP not prove to be viable, there are alternative configurations. A combination of wind generation, solar PV, and regional hydro could substitute all or at least most of the CSP and additional nuclear could make up the difference (See IRP 2010 documentation DOE 2013). As mentioned previously, assumptions are conservative and should not be a threat to robustness. The 2050 vehicle efficiencies are robust. For example, average light vehicle efficiencies assumed in 2050, namely 4 and 3.2 l/100km for gasoline and diesel vehicles, are already available for individual commercial models available today. The 5% sales of EVs by 2050 is a conservative target and hence robust. CCS has not been included because South Africa has not identified disposal sites despite the considerable efforts that have been devoted to their exploration. A government decision has been taken not to pursue ocean storage; geological storage is still being investigated and could provide additional reduction potentials, notably in the industrial sectors. Four subsectors account for 85% of direct (non-electricity induced) emissions, namely iron and steel (28%), other (24%), mining and quarrying (19%), and chemical and petrochemical (14%). Cement and glass (6%) and paper and pulp (6%) raise this to 97% of emissions. Opportunities for significant deeper cuts that have been quantifiable, based on data and knowledge accessible in this phase of the DDPP project, mainly exist through improving emissions intensities in the iron and steel subsector and/or limiting production of the subsector to local requirements, which is viewed as an option in the DDPP approach.23 The DDP includes an iron and steel sector that increases production from 10-47 Mt from 2010-2050 with emissions of 39 MtCO2eq in 2050, i.e. 0.83 tCO2eq/t. This can be compared with an international benchmark range of 0.47-0.84 tCO2eq/t. Most of these emissions are coal and gas emissions 23 Insufficient data has been (readily/publically) accessible in this phase on other industrial subsectors to assess cuts deeper than the DDP. Improvements are probably possible in cement and glass and paper and pulp but their relatively small contribution made this too minor to consider in this phase. 152 associated with providing thermal end-use energy. Substituting the remaining coal with gas technology would achieve 0.73 tCO2eq/t, i.e. a reduction of 4.7 MtCO2eq. If intensity were decreased24 from 0.73 t/tCO2eq/t to 0.47 t/tCO2eq/t, further emissions reductions of some 12.2 MtCO2eq could be achieved, reducing emissions to 24 MtCO2eq. The iron and steel sector exports about a third of its production. If this remained similar for 2050 production and the sector was limited to providing for local demand, another approximately one-third of 24 MtCO2eq, i.e. 8 Mt, could be saved. The majority of South African energy intensive industrial plants were constructed in an era of very low electricity and coal prices and no GHG emissions constraints; it is therefore reasonable that substantial improvements in energy efficiencies and GHG emissions performance, similar to those in the iron and steel subsector, could be achieved, but the lack of readily available or accessible data for other subsectors has not allowed for meaningful estimations in this phase of the DDP project. There is a low level of electrification of passenger transport in the Illustrative DDP, and only conventional fossil-based liquid fuels are considered, providing opportunities for significantly deeper cuts involving electric vehicles (EVs) and biofuels. The large contribution of kerosene combustion emissions for jet-transportation also provides a potential deep cut. If 50% of EVs were introduced by 2050, approximately 80 PJ of gasoline + 35 PJ diesel p.a. would be saved, reducing emissions by 8 MtCO2eq. If biofuels were introduced for 50% of the remaining light passenger vehicles, 14%, or 4 MtCO2eq would be saved. If biofuels were substituted for the jet-fuel, then roughly 6 Mt CO2eq would be saved. These ballpark estimates of fuel and technology substitutions save 18 MtCO2eq of the 29 MtCO2eq of passenger emissions in 2050, or some 60% of passenger transport emissions. Substituting 50% of the diesel used in freight transport with biofuels would save 11 MtCO2eq. CTL facilities are the core of the largest industrial complex and largest industrial company in South Africa. Phasing out or decarbonisation of CTL thus presents a significant challenge. The early retirement of large coal-fired electricity generation plants departs radically from official plans (DOE, 2013) and requires the construction of considerably more costly CSP plants and a large expansion to the transmission network. It is unlikely that South Africa could cover such major costs without international assistance. 24 These estimations are not based on actual South African iron and steel plant performance metrics but on estimations based on public energy consumption data and aggregate projections 35 years ahead and thus are indicative only. 153 Production capacities in 2050 are multiples of 2010 capacities, and so by 2050 most of the plant and equipment will be new and in theory should be able to be at the best end of international benchmarks ranges. Industries involved in the majority of emissions, which are from large facilities, are typically owned and operated by multinationals who own and operate world-class facilities worldwide. The challenge would thus be to get these multinationals to invest in the best-emissions class facilities in South Africa. If industry is to grow at a rate consistent with an economy that can support socio-economic development and make an appropriate contribution to achieving the PPD, regulations and incentives will have to be put in place to ensure that consistency with the PPD is maintained and that investment remains attractive when the trade-offs between cost and reducing emissions intensity are considered. The challenge will be to develop and mobilize policy, strategic planning, finance, project implementation, and administration to realize the BRT and rail projects and to implement complimentary policies in road traffic management to achieve the modal shifts. This will require significant development of management and administrative capacity and sourcing of finance.  Avoiding lock-in to large emissions intensive energy system assets with long economic lifetimes is crucial. Emissions from coal-fired electricity generation will take up emissions space required by other sectors and maintain a level of emissions in electricity that will cause induced emissions from other sectors to limit their potential to contribute to socio-economic development in a carbon-constrained world.  The PPD policy as specified in the Climate Change Response White Paper (CCRWP) needs to be implemented. The CCRWP defines the PPD and elaborates how policies will be implemented to achieve the PPD.  Fast tracking of the necessary capacity to develop and implement transport strategies and plans to build transport infrastructure and to regulate and incentivize modal shifts is necessary. 154 DEA 2011.

South Africa Overview retrieved March 31 2014 at http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview.pdf 155 The Republic of Korea (South Korea or Korea, hereafter) recorded per capita GDP of 20,159 US$ in 2010. The Korean economy recorded a high growth rate of 6.9% p.a. from the 1960s until the 2000s, following the export-led industrialization strategy. As of 2010, industry was the main sector of the economy (41% of GDP), dominated by manufacturing, which alone represented 30.3%. Electricity, gas, water, and construction accounted for 8.3%, and agriculture, forestry and fishery made up the remaining 2.6%. This fast industrial development has been driven by the strong growth of exports; in 2010, they accounted for 46% of GDP. The development of industry has also encouraged rapid urbanization, with the urbanization rate reaching 83% in 2010. Manufacturing accounted for 51.6% of Koreas final energy consumption, of which energy-intensive heavy industries constituted the dominant share of 81.0%. Koreas economy is highly dependent on fossil fuels, which represent 85% of total primary energy supply. Given its very low domestic endowment of fossil resources, 96.5% of this fossil fuel demand is met by importation, which poses the crucial question of energy security. On the other hand, renewable energy, including wastes and hydro power, accounted for only 2.8% of total primary energy supply due to the limited endowment of renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind supply. Nuclear energy accounted for 12.2% of total primary energy supply in 2010. In 2008, under President Lee Myung-bak, the Korean government launched the National Strategy for Green Growth (2009-2050), along with the first 5-Year Plan for Green Growth (2009-2013), proposing to pursue the following three objectives: (1) climate change action and energy independence, (2) the creation of new growth engines with investment in green technologies and industries, and (3) greening of the national territory, transportation, and lifestyles, while promoting a shift to high-value-added services over the period to 2050. The succeeding government of President Park Geun-hye has launched the 2nd 5-Year Plan for Green Growth (2014-2017), proposing to focus on GHG emissions reduction, a sustainable energy system, and adaptation to climate change. 156 Net GHG emissions including all sources and sinks were 624 MtCO2-eq in 2010, about 12.63 tons per capita. Emissions from fuel combustion were 562 MtCO2-eq, which corresponded to 84.1% of total emissions (668 MtCO2-eq, excluding sinks) and 90.0% of net emissions (Figure 1a). Electricity generation and industry are the two main activities responsible for energy-related carbon emissions (Figure 1b). Net GHG emissions rose during the past twenty years by 132% from 269 MtCO2eq (1990) to 624 (2010), while emissions from fuel combustion increased by 139% from 235 MtCO2eq to 561 MtCO2eq. The key driver of the rapid increase of emissions was a rise in energy consumption due to high economic growth dependent on energy-intensive heavy industry that more than offset increases in energy efficiency. Large increases in electricity emissions reflected a massive shift in final energy demand from oil and gas to electricity due to a relatively low price of electricity made possible by increases in nuclear power supply as well as the low electricity price policy of the government. There was also an upturn of carbon intensity during the second half of the 2000s mainly due to an expansion of the coal-using iron and steel industries and coal-power plants (Figure 2). 157 Koreas population is projected to peak in 2030 and to decline thereafter, decreasing from 50 million in 2010 to 48 million in 2050. The economy is projected to grow at the annualized rate of 2.35% on the average over this period. A major uncertainty facing Korea is when, if at all, and how, the inter-Korean unification is likely to occur. The present study ignores this contingency altogether. With the global benchmark of 1.7 tons of CO2 emissions per person in 2050, the illustrative pathway seeks a very ambitious decarbonization path for the Korean economy and reaches an 85.4% reduction of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Emissions are projected to fall from 560 MtCO2 in 2010 to 82 MtCO2 in 2050. This is permitted by a drastic decrease of energy consumption (-37.2% in final energy consumption) due to large improvements in energy efficiency. In addition, there are important changes in the fuel mix. In particular, the importance of oil-based fuels, which represent one-half of final consumption in 2010, is significantly reduced, and coal use is almost completely phased-out over the period (Figure 3). In parallel, electricity (and notably of renewable sources) develops with an electrification rate of final uses reaching 60.7% in 2050 (vs. less than 20% in 2010) with significant reductions of the carbon intensity of electricity production, from 531 to 41 gCO2/kWh (Figure 4). All sectors are concerned and see their emissions decreasing radically over 2010-2050 (Figure 5). 158 159 A broad set of low-carbon options for electricity generation (CCS, renewable energy such as wind and solar PV, and nuclear power) are deployed to permit the deep decarbonization of electricity supply as measured by a fall in the carbon intensity of electricity from 531 to 41gCO2/kWh. CCS is applied to 4% of coal power generation by 2050, and all coal without CCS and a share of gas are substituted with renewables, specifically wind (14% of electricity production) and solar PV (31% of production), due to the installation of 51 GW of wind and 193 GW of solar PV. Residual fossil fuels are substituted with nuclear energy, requiring the installation of 47 GW of nuclear power. The deployment of renewable energy requires the shift to a large-scale distributed renewable electricity system. As a result, network balancing is likely to be an issue because of the intermittency of renewable energy. Additional tools such as backup facilities and energy storage should be installed to solve this problem. 160 The manufacturing sector was the dominant source of CO2 emissions in 2010 with 186 MtCO2. It includes the energy-intensive heavy industries,25 and the share of these industries in GDP is projected to increase from 27.2% in 2010 to 35.3% in 2050. This aggregate figure hides a structural change among industrial sub-sectors, as the share of fabricated metal industries increases while that of other heavy industries (such as cement, petrochemical, and iron and steel) decreases).26 Manufacturing is almost decarbonized by 2050 to 16.4 MtcCO2 of emissions, excluding indirect emission through electricity.27 This occurs through a combination of significant deviations from the current trajectory, notably through efficiency improvements resulting in 1) three-fold and six-fold decreases of energy intensity (with respect to the 2010 level) in light and heavy industries, respectively, 2) substitution for 20% of fossil fuels in distributed CHP in heavy industries, 3) 30% deployment of CHP to fuel light industries, and 4) an increase to 28% and 72% of the shares of electricity in light and heavy industries, respectively. Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. In the residential buildings sector, a 62% reduction of emissions is experienced, from 37.5 MtCO2 in 2010 to 14.5 MtCO2 in 2050. The floor space decreases from 24 m2/person to 21 m 2/person. This is permitted by a 25 Heavy industries include iron & steel, petrochemical, cement, non-metallic and fabricated metal industries. The last one here includes machinery, electronic & electric and shipbuilding sectors. 26 The share of these 3 industries in GDP is projected to decrease from 8.0% in 2010 to 4.3% in 2050. 27 Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7a also excludes indirect emission through electricity consumption. 161 combination of the following four broad groups of measures (listed in order of the ease of deployment): 1) the diffusion of LED lighting (which substitute for all exiting lighting by 2050), 2) higher efficiency of heating and cooling obtained with new technologies, 3) substituting fossil fuels in distributed Combined Heat and Power (CHP) (which substitute 17% of fossil fuels in distributed CHP in 2010 mainly with wastes and complementarily with biomass), and 4) substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy (solar-thermal and geo-thermal energy substitute 35% of the remaining fossil fuels in 2010). The commercial buildings sector includes buildings in business, public, and agricultural sectors. In this sector, despite the continuous increase of floor space per capita (from 14 m2/person in 2010 to 31 m2/person in 2050), CO2 emissions are reduced by 78% from 24.5 MtCO2 in 2010 to 5.4 MtCO2 in 2050. This is notably permitted by efficiency improvements in heating and cooling, waste heat and biomass in distributed CHP (substituting 11% of fossil fuels in distributed CHP in 2010 primarily with waste heat and complementarily with biomass), and the diffusion of renewable energy (substituting 35% of residual fuels in 2010 with solar-thermal and geo-thermal energy). The passenger kilometers per person increases from 13,400 pkm/person in 2010 to 26,300 pkm/person in 2050. The transportation sector, however, experiences a drastic 87% reduction of CO2 emissions from 81.4 MtCO2 in 2010 to 11.2 MtCO2 in 2050. This is permitted by a major efficiency improvement in fossil fuel vehicles (cars, trucks, and buses), biofuel deployment (biodiesel representing 20% of the diesel used in 2050), deep electrification of the car fleet (up to 80% of the stock), and the modal shift in both passenger transportation, with 70% of passenger cars in 2010 substituted with public transport such as urban buses and trains, and freight transportation, with 78% of road freight in 2010 substituted with rail freight. Such a revolutionary modal shift28 would require a reorganization of the national transportation system as elaborated in section 2.5. In the illustrative pathway discussed above, the technical options have been introduced based on a consideration of the presumed relative costs or ease of implementing the options, as determined through discussions with leading experts from both research institutes and the related business firms with expertise in the individual technology options This has privileged particular efficiency improvements, waste energy use and fuel change, or new energy resources (e.g., renewable), while other solutions face greater technical or public opinion difficulties as detailed more precisely below:  LED in lighting: the LEDs energy saving rate is 72%.29  Higher efficiency in heating and cooling in residential and commercial sectors: energy savings due to improved insulation are 58.4%.30  Advancements in the efficiency of fossil fuel cars: the efficiency improvements of cars (excluding buses) and buses should be 158.5% and 45.9% respectively by 2050.31 28 Being studied by the Korea Transport Institute. 29 Average saving rate compared to incandescent & fluorescent lighting (Source: Technology DB provided by Korea Institute of Energy Research) 30 Korean technology DB, Korea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO) 162  Biodiesel deployment in transport: biodiesel is to be blended into diesel for 20% of the diesel used in 2050. The existing diesel vehicles can accommodate this option.32  Solar PV facilities specification is about 0.163 GW/km.2 The total area allotted to transport roads in Korea is about 3,000 km2, and 193GW can be supplied from 40% of this area. Introduce CCS: The CCS capture efficiency will be 90%. The storage potential in Korea is estimated to not exceed 15MtCO2.33 Accordingly, introduction of CCS for more than 5% will be prohibited by the storage space constraint.  The illustrative pathway scenario for the power sector depends on renewable energies, mostly for emission reduction. An alternative scenario depends mainly on CCS: (1) Introduce CCS for 76% of coal power generation by 2050. (2) Substitute 20% of gas with renewable energies, such as wind and solar PV. 51 GW of wind and 69 GW of solar PV should be installed. (3) Substitute all residual coal without CCS with nuclear energy. 44 GW of nuclear power should be installed. In this scenario, CO2 emission reductions from CCS add up to 300 MtCO2 or 92.8% of total reduction in the power sector. However, this amounts to twenty times the domestic storage potential. This scenario assumes the availability of foreign storage spaces, an assumption that must be examined and confirmed. Korea could consider another pathway that depends mainly on nuclear power: (1) Introduce CCS for 5% of coal generation by 2050. (2) Substitute fossil fuels with renewable energy by installing 29 GW of wind power and 14 GW of solar PV. (3) Substitute all coal without CCS and gas with nuclear energy. 84 GW of nuclear power should be installed. In this scenario, CO2 emissions reductions from nuclear adds up to 296 MtCO2 or 91.1% of total reductions in the power sector. This scenario assumes that the problem of public acceptance associated with nuclear energy, which is currently very serious in Korea, will be addressed as discussed in the next section. Korea has one of the highest energy intensities in the OECD largely because of its industrial sector, which is dominated by energy-intensive heavy industries. Koreas green growth strategy proposes to 31 Ibid. 32 A more extensive deployment of this option in Korea is expected to be difficult because of the insufficient resource potential for biodiesel. 33 According to assessment by relevant Korean experts. 163 promote a shift of the economic structure toward high value-added services. The present analysis has not allowed for such policy-induced structural changes of the economy. High levels of emissions are associated with some production processes, notably, those of the steel industry. POSCO, the leading steel producer, is responsible for about 10% of Koreas GHG emission. They have developed and begun to deploy a new technology called FINEX, which reduces emissions by 40%.34 New and replacement installations of plants over time will allow for the increased deployment of FINEX, leading to even greater reductions in CO2 emissions by 2050. There is significant unexplored potential for energy savings and efficiency improvements in all sectors from a reform of the electricity pricing system. Currently, Koreas power system operates on an antiquated pricing system, which distinguishes several customer groups (residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, educational, and public) and charges different prices set by the government according to economic, industrial, and social considerations. The prices are occasionally adjusted, with a major systemic impact on the energy system. The current system is biased toward underpricing below the cost of generation and encourages the wasteful consumption of electricity, not only by underpricing per se but by more critically by preventing demand response and cost-based optimization of electricity consumption by customers. More broadly, it discourages investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Shifting to a market-based pricing system would dramatically transform the energy system by broadening the choice space and deployment potential for various options. Exploration of these possibilities requires rather extensive study. Further along this line of analysis, over the long-term to 2050, there is an explosive potential for deep decarbonization from the disruptive convergence of renewable energy, energy storage, advanced materials (such as graphene and carbon nanotubes), and Internet of Things, involving transformation toward a distributed power generation system.35 The Asian Super Grid proposed by the Softbank Group of Japan should be seriously explored.36 The core idea is to harness Mongols enormous endowment of wind and solar energy resources. When fully deployed, these resources are projected to supply 70% of the global power demand, including demand from Japan, Korea, China, and others, and even replace all current nuclear power plants.37 The Asian Super Grid would connect national transmission lines through the existing internet cables and link all major Asian cities from the renewable energy power stations in the Gobi Desert to Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, even to Delhi and Mumbai, and eventually to the European Desertec Super Grid. 34 While direct emission is reduced by 40%, it indirectly increases emission by 30% by using more electricity under the current carbon intensity of electricity. 35 The 21st Century Energy System: Transformation of Energy System through Convergence, A power point presentation by Namsung Ahn, Korea Institute Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), June 10, 2014. 36 Proposed by Masayoshi Sohn, Chairman of the Softbank Group on September 13, 2012, as he launched the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, as a solution to replace the nuclear power system in Japan as well as in the rest of Asia. 164 Under the Illustrative Deep Decarbonization scenario presented in this study, CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in 2050 are reduced by about 85% relative to 2010. Key challenges for this scenario are summarized as follows:  Considering Koreas low energy efficiency relative to value-added in energy-intensive industries (such as steel, petrochemicals, and cement38), improvement of the efficiency in these industries would depend innovation and dematerialization of production; a modernization of the electricity pricing system would also be necessary to provide the correct price incentives for energy efficiency improvements. largely on process  Substituting 80% of fossil fuel cars with electric vehicles by 2050 requires cutting the cost of batteries (which essentially depends on international technology actions) and building a nationwide charging infrastructure;  Decarbonizing the power sector requires the shift to a large-scale distributed renewable electricity system as well as installation of backup facilities (gas-fired combined-cycle, etc.), large energy storages (pumping power, batteries, etc.) and the deployment of a smart grid to solve the intermittency problem of renewable energy;  The large modal shift in both passenger and freight transportation to public and rail transportation projected in this study would require a revolutionary reorganization of the national transportation system. Key to reorganization should be an extensive national high-speed rail network with urban and regional rapid mass transportation systems built around l high-speed- rail stations, supplemented with new conveyor-belt type rail freight services,39 and double-deck freight trains serving main freight transportation routes. The current system of explicit and implicit subsidies for freight trucking and urban parking should be withdrawn;  Continued deployment of nuclear power requires a fundamental solution to the widespread concern over its safety and especially over disposal of the spent fuel. Deployment of the SMART40 model, which allows passive cooling, would considerably allay the maintenance safety concern by preventing a Fukushima-type meltdown of the reactor. Development and deployment of the pyro-processing technology for transmutation of high-level waste to mid- level waste would fundamentally allay the concern over the spent-fuel disposal problem by recycling the fuel. But it would take one to two decades of international R&D cooperation to develop the necessary technology;  Shift to a distributed power generation system will be necessary in order to overcome the Not- in-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY) problem obstructing the installation of various facilities including the transmission lines. 37 According to the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, wind power generation in the Gobi Desert will amount to 8,100TWh and solar power generation in Gobi to 4,800TWh annually. 38 Korea is among the countries which boast the highest energy efficiency in these industries when the efficiency is measured against output. 39 This technology is being developed by the Korea Transport Institute. 40 SMART stands for System-integrated Modular Advanced ReacTor. SMART was developed by Korea in 2012, is one tenth (100MW) the size of the existing model (1000MW) and would fit distributed power system. 165 To be realistic, nuclear power and fossil-fuel power generation with CCS each offer the largest scope for decarbonization of the energy system to 2050. But the problem of disposal of the spent fuel from nuclear power presents one of the most serious obstacles to deploying nuclear power. The pyro- processing technology, if and when it becomes available, will essentially solve this problem. Accordingly, Korea should urgently enter a joint international research program on the technology with the United States, in which Korea has a binding agreement on disposal of its spent fuel. In the case of CCS, the seemingly limited availability of storage space in Koreas coastal seas is the main obstacle. Korea should urgently explore the possibility of entering agreements with suppliers of coal and natural gas, such as Australia, which could allow Korea to lease storage spaces. Improving the energy efficiency, in buildings, transport, and industry offers the largest scope for decarbonization in the near-term. This requires, among other things, increases in energy prices, including that of electricity, carbon pricing of energy in general, and market-based pricing of electricity. Correct pricing is necessary and urgent, accompanied by strengthening of the appropriate energy efficiency and emission standards. The same set of measures would also facilitate development and deployment of renewable energy. In Korea, in particular, there seems to be a serious limit to deployment of solar panels because of the large space requirement. An alternative should be the installation of BIPV on the walls of buildings. Accordingly, development and deployment of BIPV should be a high priority. As to wind power, the objections from local residents or national park authorities to installation of the wind turbines is a serious obstacle to its deployment on land. The promising alternative is the ocean wind turbine. The development and deployment of this technology is a high priority. Another high-priority plan is the replacement of the current centralized electricity generation system with a distributed electricity generation system, including extensive deployment of the smart grid. This calls for a systemic reorganization of the national power system, a major reform to be carried over a decade or longer. The most urgent priority, however, is to develop and build a national consensus on the long-term target for deep decarbonization of the Korean economy. This would in turn require widespread understanding of the objective conditions for Koreas positioning on how to apportion the collective responsibility for global decarbonization among the leading emitters today, of the range of the plausible technological pathways as well as their implications for the requisite energy system transformation. Furthermore, such consensus-building should be informed by understanding of what the pathways would entail in terms of benefits and costs to the economy and society. The present deep decarbonization study conducted as part of an international collaborative project involving 15 main emitters provides an ideal science-based platform on which to build such understanding and the needed consensus. And Koreas green growth strategy provides an ideal organizing framework for studies and debates toward those understanding. Within the framework of the green growth strategy, Korea should seriously explore the long-term decarbonization potential to build a national consensus on the best pathway as well as the requisite action agenda for green growth 166 during next few years. Such exploration should be based on a concrete roadmap for development and deployment of the necessary technologies. 167 Part of the G20 group of nations, the UK is an advanced economy with trade focused in services, and a declining manufacturing base over recent decades. Once a large producer of oil and gas, declining reserves have increased import dependency in recent years. A large energy infrastructure exists due to the historical reliance on gas for heating and high level of electrification. The changing economy and energy system have led to three key energy policy issues emerging over the last 10 years: energy security, affordability, and system decarbonization. The case for deep decarbonization of the UK energy system was first made in a landmark report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 2000,41 which proposed a voluntary 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, recognizing the serious challenge of climate change. Over the decade that followed, the Government undertook a number of strategic analyses, notably in 2003 and 2007,42 which further assessed the techno-economic implications of deep decarbonization. These strategies, and supporting modelling,43 laid the foundation, in 2008, for the UK to be the first G20 economy to legislate a long-term emission reduction target. Under the Climate Change Act 2008,44 a GHG reduction target of 80% is to be achieved by 2050 (relative to 1990 levels), with a set of 5-year carbon budgets independently proposed and monitored by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The Illustrative Deep Decarbonization Pathway scenario described in this chapter reflects both government-led and independent analysis undertaken over the past 5 years, assessing a range of transition pathways. Its core focus is on timely emission reductions to ensure that the longer-term target objective is not undermined, and on delivery of these reductions in the most cost-effective way. The scenario also assumes domestic action only, with no explicit use of international offsets. 41 RCEP (2000).

The three sectors that constitute the largest sources of emissions include power generation, transport, and buildings, accounting for 77% of total CO2 emissions. In per capita terms, GHG emissions are 9.6 tCO2e/capita, and 7.9 tCO2/capita for CO2 emissions only. Source: UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory, 1990 to 2012. Annual Report for Submission under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. April 2014. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-inventory Since 1990, GHG emissions have been falling, and in 2010 were 22% below 1990 levels. Over half of this reduction (56%) can be attributed to CO2 emissions, with the remainder from non-CO2 emissions. A key driver of the reduction in CO2 emissions has been the large-scale take-up of gas for power generation (the so-called dash for gas), reducing the UKs historical reliance on coal (Figure 2). The other key driver has been economic restructuring, with large reductions in emissions from industrial energy use (including in iron and steel sector) over the period and a general shift to a lower energy- intensive economy. Efficiency gains in end-use sectors (buildings, transport) have led to either no growth or small decreases in emissions, relative to 1990, despite rising incomes and population growth. For non-CO2 gases, the main reductions have been in CH4 emissions in the agriculture sector, and N2O emissions in specific industrial processes. 169 Source: Strachan, N., Kannan, R., & Pye, S. (2007). Final report on DTI-DEFRA scenarios and sensitivities using the UK MARKAL and MARKAL-macro energy system models. Policy Studies Institute / UK Energy Research Centre. Current government forecasts suggest that the UK economy will continue to grow at around 2.5% over the long term (between 2022 and 2050) and 2.2% in the near term45 and that population will increase to 70.8 million by 2030 and 76.6 million by 2050,46 from the current population in 2012 of 63.7 million. These underlying drivers make emission reductions challenging. This illustrative UK decarbonization pathway has a strong focus on early decarbonization of the power sector by 2030, with low-carbon electricity becoming an enabling route for emission reductions in end- use sectors over the 2030-2050 period, replacing gas use in buildings and use of liquids fuels in transport (see Figure 3). In combination with fuel switching through electrification, robust efficiency and technology retrofit by 2030 in the transport and buildings sectors are also envisaged, with more radical technological and infrastructure change through to 2050, as the energy system further decarbonizes. 45 OBR (2013).

Use is focused in power generation and district heating, but also in industry and buildings. Biofuel use in the transport sector does not increase by 2050 in absolute terms due to the large-scale reduction in use of oil products, which fall from 46 to 11 Mtoe by 2050. Gas, while only playing a small role in end-use sectors (as shown above), remains important for power generation in CCS plants, and by 2050, the sector uses over 30% more than current levels. Overall, gas use decreases by 23% due to its reduced role in heating buildings and industrial production. Changes result in energy-related CO2 reductions being 40% below 2010 levels by 2030 and 68% lower by 2050 (relative to 1990 levels, this is a 57% and 86% reduction respectively). This equates to a reduction in per capita CO2 levels from 7.9 tonnes in 2010 to 3.6 tonnes in 2030 and to 1.1 tonne in 2050. Figure 4 highlights the key drivers of emissions and the impact of pillars of decarbonization. The switch to lower-carbon fuels is a key pillar, with carbon intensity of final energy consumption (FEC) falling 78% 171 by 2050. This reflects increasing electrification of end-use energy services, a shift away from gas use in buildings (-69%), and increasing uptake of bioenergy. Abatement action in power generation plays a critical role in the decarbonization of energy supply; by 2050, the carbon intensity of generation is less than zero. Energy efficiency gains are illustrated by a 21% reduction in FEC and a 71% reduction in energy intensity of GDP. This reflects significant uptake of increasingly efficient technologies, particularly in the transport and building sectors, by 2050. As shown in Figure 4, all of these drivers are decreasing at a rate much greater than growing emission drivers, including population and GDP per capita (Table 1). Table 1. Aggregate indicators under UK illustrative scenario Scenario indicators Unit 2010 2050 Population GDP/capita Millions US $/capita 63 35600 77 75800 Finally, structural and behavioral change play important roles in reducing FEC. In addition to efficiency gains, the reduction in energy intensity of industrial consumption also reflects structural changes in the economy, with growth in high value, less energy-intensive sectors, and a reduction in energy-intensive industries, in part due to global competitiveness impacts. Price-induced behavioral change further reduces energy service demand in passenger transport and building by 7.5% and 10% in 2050, saving an additional 4% of CO2 emissions. The change in energy-related CO2 emission levels highlight the efforts required across all sectors (Figure 5). The power generation sector sees dramatic reductions in both absolute and relative terms. Buildings and transport sectors also see large absolute reductions although retain similar shares of overall emissions. Overall, energy-related CO2 emissions decrease by 83%. Lower reductions in non- CO2 emissions of 57% mean that their share of total emissions in 2050 nearly doubles, to around 35%. 172 This scenario is characterized by early decarbonization of the power sector and a large expansion in capacity to enable electrification of end use sectors. To achieve this, investment in 30-40 GW of low- carbon capacity in the 2020s is required, reducing carbon intensity of generation from a current level of 500 gCO2/kWh to well below 100 gCO2/kWh by 2030. By 2050, a large expansion in nuclear and gas with CCS and wind is envisaged (Figure 6), all well within the estimated UK wind and CO2 storage resource potential. The overall capacity of the system is expected to increase to more than 140 GW, from the 2010 level of 88 GW. The intensity of carbon generation falls to below zero, due to the generation of electricity from biomass with CCS, which saves an estimated 19 MtCO2. With over 50 GW of intermittent capacity on the system in 2050, there is a continued role for open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) plant as backup and other grid-based and end-use sector storage technologies. Strong growth in passenger and freight transport demands to 2050 make deep emission reductions especially challenging. Passenger demand is driven by population growth, and an 8% increase in per capita demand for passenger travel along with a 45% increase in freight transport demand reflect a growing economy and increasing per capita consumption. As a result, the transport sector accounts for around 50% of energy-related emissions in 2050 (Figure 5). In the car vehicle stock, action to reduce emissions is first through a strong transition to hybrid vehicles in the 2020s and then to plug-in 173 hybrid/battery electric vehicles (EVs) in 2030s and beyond. By 2050, 65% of car passenger travel is met by EVs. Limited penetration of a hydrogen network in specific regions sees hydrogen provide only 20% of demand. Overall, efficiency of road passenger travel increases significantly, with a 40% reduction in FEC despite growing demand. Transport road freight sees a move towards hydrogen and dual gas fueled vehicles. Diesel still accounts for 30% of road freight demand but with a higher share of biodiesel than observed for lighter duty vehicles. Energy demand in residential buildings is based on projected growth in dwellings of 34% between 2010 and 2050, rising from 26.6 to 35.5 million. While constituting a much smaller share of total energy use, commercial sector floor space is also projected to grow from 0.55 to 0.86 billion m2. The key mitigation actions in this sector include retrofitting of the existing build stock using a range of different energy efficiency measures (near- to mid-term) and decarbonization of heat through electrification (heat pumps/resistive electric heaters) and district heating (mid- to longer-term). District heating is primarily supplied via waste heat recovery, biomass, and gas. The scenario suggests a pathway that radically reduces the role of gas for heating in buildings, with supply reducing from 44 to 7 BCM by 2050. Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. Industrial sector emissions fall in part due to a reduction in energy intensity of production, which decreases from 62 to 35 toes/m. This is both due to efficiency gains and ongoing industrial restructuring, with a move to higher value production sectors (for example, in chemicals) and shrinking energy intensive production capacity (including iron and steel and non-ferrous metals). The decrease in 174 the carbon intensity of FEC (Table 2) reflects fuel switching to electricity and biomass, accounting for about 70% of total FEC in 2050, and industrial CCS on industrial plants which continue to use gas. The decarbonization pathway described relies on a large-scale shift to low-carbon power generation, based on a portfolio of options including nuclear, CCS, and renewables, particularly wind. Nuclear capacity is 32 GW in 2050, implying a build rate of 1 GW/year from 2020, the date when the first 3rd generation plant is planned to have been built. Higher annual build rates for gas CCS capacity of 1.5 GW will be needed, which will be challenging given the technological and CCS infrastructure novelty. Once demonstrated, the UK is well placed to benefit from this emerging technology, with significant storage capacity for captured CO2, particularly in the North Sea. The technical capacity of the UK (including continental shelf) is estimated to be in the region of 70 billion tonnes, sufficient to store a 100 years worth of current emissions from the energy sector.47 Wind generation also plays a strong role in this scenario, providing almost 100 TWh in 2050, based on capacity levels of 35 GW, which is well within the practical resource potential available of over 400 TWh for UK.48 Implied build rates of under 1 GW are similar to those being currently observed in the UK. The building sector offers strong potential for retrofit to reduce energy use through fabric upgrade. In 2030, the CCC estimate annual savings of 7 MtCO2 (sector emissions are approx. 40 MtCO2).49 Key measures include solid and cavity wall insulation, loft insulation, improved controls, and behavioral measures. However, there is also an important heat replacement effect due to more efficient appliances, which increases heating requirement (and reduces savings). Rapid switching to heat pumps and establishment of large numbers of district heating schemes see the gas distribution grid redundant by 2050. In household terms, this equates to 20 million homes switching to these systems from gas by 2050, or an average of 500,000 per year over the period. The electrification of passenger road transport is assumed to take place at scale in the 2030s. This assumes EVs will be cost-competitive, the required manufacturing capacity is in place to meet demand, and a level of charging infrastructure is in place that provides confidence for uptake. This scenario assumes around 25 million EVs are on the road by 2050. Penetration in the market place during 2020s of 20-25% of new cars sales (on average) could establish a fleet of 5 million EVs by 2030. Post-2030, stronger growth would be required, with EVs accounting for 50-60% of new car sales. Biomass plays an increasingly important role in the energy system transition. The bioenergy levels used in the UK scenario are in the center of the range of resource potential considered in recent UK analysis, taking account of share of global resources.50 Modelling for the study suggested optimal use in power 47 DECC (2012).

This is reflected in the UK scenario described in this chapter, alongside a strong role in the buildings (including district heating provision) and industry. The pathway described for the UK is challenging and requires a substantial diffusion of a wide range of mitigation options. However, it is important to highlight that many other decarbonization pathways are technically feasible and could be delivered under the right conditions. A recent UK synthesis study draws out commonality across modelling studies, but also highlights the different options that could achieve deep emission reductions, particularly in the power sector.51 Uncertainty analysis published by the CCC highlights differences in deployment of renewable technologies. Even when both nuclear and CCS are available, shares of renewable generation ranged from 30% to 94%, with most solutions in the range of 40% to 70%.52 This highlights the uncertainties even where all options are available and that the illustrative pathway presented here is one of many plausible futures. Further analysis is being undertaken in the UK to explore other uncertainties in energy system decarbonization, and what that means for different pathways.53 What is evident from such analyses is that reductions, particularly in the power sector, can be achieved by a range of different technologies. However, the non-availability of key technologies such as nuclear and/or CCS increases costs substantially, and tends to both increase the role of renewables and reduce the role of electrification in the energy system. In the transport sector, under an alternate pathway, hydrogen-fuelled vehicles can play an important role as a dominant vehicle technology especially for passenger cars. This depends on the cost assumptions of the relative fuel production systems, the technology and infrastructure costs, and the system-wide role for electrification. For road freight, there is less flexibility, due to the limited role for electrification. Switching to natural gas and hydrogen-based vehicles is therefore critical. There could also be a stronger role for biofuels across the transport system, the penetration of which has been limited in this scenario. Electrification of heating in buildings has been a strong feature of most modelling analyses undertaken in the UK, as gas use rapidly decreases out to 2050. Alternatives to electricity-based heating (through heat pumps) include increasing use of bioenergy, solar thermal, and district heating, which is a key element of this scenario. In summary, a significant role for electricity is required in the UK for decarbonization, although the extent of its role can be balanced against other options. Further systematic assessment of robustness of different pathways is needed, to better understand what are the key technologies and associated uncertainties that impact deep decarbonization. From a UK perspective, key issues around pathway robustness include ensuring security of electricity supply given higher peak demand and a more intermittent supply, maintaining bioenergy supply, and delivering 51 Ekins, P., Keppo I., Skea J., Strachan N., Usher W., Anandarajah G.

Recent analysis assessing the impacts of key uncertainties on delivery of decarbonization pathways analysis points to critical assumptions concerning the availability of biomass (due to its use for delivering negative emissions in 2050), and the price of gas and cost of nuclear in determining the generation mix.54 The prospective role played by demand reduction and other behavioral change measures is also highly uncertain but critical in the mix of demand and supply-side responses needed for meeting stringent targets.55 Additional reductions beyond those considered in the illustrative pathway significantly increase abatement costs and stretch credibility of technology deployment rates. Modelling studies have considered more stringent decarbonization levels,56 using scenarios to explore CO2 reductions of 90- 95% below 1990 levels (95% is equivalent to ~0.4 tCO2/capita). These scenarios are by nature exploratory but do provide some interesting insights. In the power sector, CCS becomes a less relevant technology, due to the residual emissions, resulting in larger nuclear and renewable capacities. The exception is biomass CCS (in one analysis), which provides important negative emission credits. In the transport sector, the share of biofuels increases while all hydrogen production is fully decarbonized. In a number of scenarios, it is only the increased role of price-induced demand response that allows the model to meet the stringent reduction levels. The feasibility of this level of reduction is questionable, both from a techno-economic and political perspective. Most of these analyses suggest marginal costs of abatement of over $US 1,200/tCO2 or higher by 2050. The question is whether this level of mitigation could be incentivized and whether political will could be sustained. However, it is also worth noting that most modelling studies do not account for radical social change resulting in changing behavior. For example, there are a range of measures in the transport sector that could lead to radical demand reductions e.g. modal shift, including a move to non-motorized transport, changes in patterns of living/work aided by urban planning, and increased uptake of telecommunications as an alternative.57 Transforming the energy system requires strong and maintained policy interventions in technology development, leveraging capital investment, removal of market barriers, and enabling behavioral change. In the power sector, a key challenge is the scale of investment required in low-carbon technologies. For strong decarbonization of the sector by 2030, estimates of total cumulative 54 Pye, S., Sabio, N. & Strachan, N. (2014).

Energy Policy, 41, 125-138. 177 investment range from 200bn to over 300bn. Based on recent analysis, this means an average investment requirement of 6.1bn/year (3.4 GW per year of new capacity) to 2020, increasing to 12.3bn (5.7 GW) to 2030 due to the increased construction of capital-intensive low-carbon plant, and greater levels of plant retirement. 58 Mitigating investment risks is critical; the Electricity Market Reforms (EMR) introduced by the UK Government seeks to incentivize large-scale investment in less mature low-carbon generation.59 Notable uncertainties remain about the viability of CCS, since it has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated at scale. A strong focus now on CCS by the UK and other countries could see its wide- scale deployment in the late 2020s. Strong capacity in the offshore industry means the UK would be in a good position to benefit from this technology (as is the case for offshore wind). Demonstrating cost- effective deployment of the first new nuclear reactor in the UK in 20 years (at Hinkley Point C) will be critical to increase acceptability on cost grounds, as well as broader public acceptability. An increased role for renewables, particularly wind, could lead to increased technical operational challenges due to the higher share of intermittency. However, analysis suggests that high shares need not materially impact the security of supply given a range of options to address intermittency, such as demand response, storage, and interconnection.60 Finally an additional challenge is high infrastructure costs. For wind, other renewables, and CO2 storage, much of the resource is offshore and often located in remote areas, such as Northern Scotland. Decarbonization of heat in buildings will require a radical shift away from piped natural gas (and potential decommissioning of the gas distribution system) to electrification via heat pumps and/or introduction of district heating systems. Large-scale uptake of heat pumps will require householder incentives for switching and a supply chain capacity to be in place. There may also need to be significant reinforcement of the electricity distribution system, especially with smart metering and two- way flows of electricity. District heating systems will require a financing mechanism, perhaps via local authorities, and could run up against public acceptability issues. Electrification of road passenger cars (especially for the 70% of travel demand that is made up of trips of less than 50 miles) is a key mitigation option. A major challenge concerns large-scale uptake which will be dependent on some level of charging infrastructure, and the necessary incentives to get around the higher costs associated with the battery technology.61 In a recent study, three key uncertainties were highlighted to large-scale uptake, as envisaged under this scenario: 1) long-term certainty across different incentives, 2) lack of an integrated payment mechanism for EV charging, and 3) more robust methodologies for the estimation of the environmental performance, costs, and range limitations to 58 Blyth, W., McCarthy, R. & Gross, R.

For the industry sector, limited modelling on economic structural change, the role of CCS, and potential for fuel switching make the uncertainties considerable. Capturing the impact of global decarbonization on UK industry is also challenging. In terms of burden on different industrial groups and regions, government action will be needed to mitigate such distributional impacts. Whilst challenging, and with large inherent uncertainties, a transition to a low-carbon economy is an opportunity for significant investment in R&D and infrastructure. This could have major benefits for economic growth due to the emergence of new industries and investment, whilst replacing and developing new energy infrastructure. A move towards lower-carbon technology and resource base could also strengthen energy security. It is clear that the Government has a strong role to play in creating the right investment environment for the transition. Key actions, many of which have or are in the process of being developed, include:  Maintaining the political will to enact the independently set 5-yearly carbon budgets with a corresponding set of implementation policies that are backed across government.  Through electricity market reforms, incentivizing investment in low-carbon generation that is capital intensive, less mature, possibly more intermittent, and requires significant payback periods.  Focusing R&D on technologies that the UK can develop economic benefits from, including industries and other energy technology in automotive offshore renewables but also manufacturers. 62 Morton, C., Anable, J. & Brand, C. (2014) Perceived Uncertainty in the Demand for Electric Vehicles: A qualitative assessment. UKERC Working Paper. London, UK: UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). 179 The United States is the worlds second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and one of the highest per capita consumers and producers of energy and fossil fuels. Deep decarbonization will require a profound transformation of the way energy is produced, delivered, and used, in a transition that is sustained over multiple generations. This analysis provides insight into what very low-carbon energy systems in the U.S. could look like and describes key steps and alternative routes to reaching a level of energy-related CO2 emissions that is consistent with an increase in global mean temperature below 2C. In 2010, U.S. energy-related emissions were approximately 18 metric tons of CO2 per person. For the U.S. to do its share in reaching the 2C target, by 2050 this per capita emissions level will need to decrease by an order of magnitude. Developing a long-term strategic vision of how the U.S. can reach this goal is essential for informing near-term policy and investment decisions and for conveying to domestic and international audiences how the U.S. can provide climate leadership while maintaining economic growth and improving standards of living. The U.S. currently does not have comprehensive federal climate legislation or a binding national GHG emissions target. Nonetheless, the U.S. has taken important steps in low-carbon policy and technology deployment at the federal, state, and local government levels. Significant recent federal government executive branch actions include setting vehicle fuel economy standards, which will nearly double for passenger cars and light trucks by the 2025 model year relative to 2010, and establishing appliance energy efficiency standards for more than 50 product categories, leading to dramatic reductions in unit energy consumption for technologies such as refrigeration and lighting. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to apply the federal Clean Air Act to CO2 emitted by power plants, setting a target of a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030, which, if implemented successfully, will hasten the transition from uncontrolled coal generation to natural gas or coal with CCS. In the U.S., states have primary jurisdiction over many key elements of the energy system, including electric and natural gas utilities, building codes, and transportation planning. This has enabled many states to develop climate and clean energy policies in the absence of federal legislation. Twenty states have adopted GHG emission targets, 29 states have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) for electricity generation, and 39 states have building energy codes. Nine Northeastern states have joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first market-based program in the U.S. for reducing power sector emissions. California, with a legally binding statewide GHG target for 2020, a deep decarbonization goal for 2050, ambitious sectoral policies, and a carbon market, is a national test case for demonstrating the cost and feasibility of a low-carbon transition. 180 U.S. GHG emissions are dominated by CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. In 2012, energy-related emissions of all kinds (including fugitive emissions from fuels) accounted for 5,499 MtCO2e, nearly 85% of total gross GHG emissions of 6,526 MtCO2e (Figure 1A). Of these, 5,072 Mt (78%) were fossil fuel combustion CO2, which is shown disaggregated by fuel source and end-use sector in Figure 1B.

With electricity emissions allocated to end-use sectors, the building sector (both residential and commercial) is the largest emissions source (38%), followed by transportation (34%) and industry (27%). Transportation-sector CO2 emissions are almost entirely from direct fossil fuel combustion, while industrial-sector CO2 emissions are divided between direct fuel combustion and electricity consumption, and building-sector emissions are primarily from electricity consumption (Figure 1B). U.S. fossil fuel combustion CO2 emissions rose from 1990 through 2005, mainly due to population and GDP growth. This growth was partly offset by improvements in energy efficiency, measured as a reduction in the energy intensity of GDP (Figure 2A). Emissions declined from 2005 to 2010, largely due to the economic slowdown after 2008. The electricity and transportation sectors accounted for the bulk of growth in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion between 1990 and 2010 (Figure 2B). The continued decline in emissions since 2010 is due to a combination of factors, including coal displacement in power generation by inexpensive natural gas. 181 Source: Based on EPA, 2014 and data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), http://www.eia.doe.gov. Note: Buildings, transportation, and industry emission are direct /emissions only, and electricity use, which is categorized separate. National deep decarbonization pathways This studys most important finding is that it is technically feasible for the U.S. to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion to less than 750 MtCO2 in 2050, which is 85% below 1990 levels and an order of magnitude decrease in per capita emissions compared to 2010. This finding is demonstrated by preliminary modeling results for four different scenarios: a main case, plus three alternative scenarios that more heavily emphasize renewable, CCS, or nuclear power generation. All four scenarios assume continued growth in key macroeconomic indicators and energy service demand drivers, consistent with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook 2013 reference case (Table 1).

Scenario Objectives and Analysis Approach Scenario Objectives Analysis Approach Avoid or limit early retirement of existing infrastructure Avoid or limit need for new infrastructure Emphasize technologies that are already commercialized Maintain electric reliability Make decarbonization measures realistic and specific Avoid environmentally unsustainable measures Maintain industrial competitiveness Achieve emission reductions domestically Exclude forest carbon sink Adapt to regional conditions and preferences Use granular annual stock rollover model with infrastructure inertia, allow equipment to cover full investment cost Minimize the use of measures that require the creation of major new types of infrastructure (e.g. CO2 pipeline) Minimize use of non-commercialized technologies and use conservative technology performance assumptions. Use hourly dispatch model to ensure adequate capacity and flexibility for all generation mixes Require granular subsector decarbonization strategies to isolate difficult cases (e.g. freight, industry) when evaluating feasibility Adhere to non-GHG sustainability limits for biomass use, hydroelectricity Adopt measures that keep compliance costs as low as possible while achieving the necessary reductions Dont assume international offsets will be available Focus on reducing energy system CO2, as this is the pivotal transition task and carbon sink behavior is poorly understood Make decarbonization strategies consistent with regional infrastructure, economics, resources, and policy preferences The scenarios were developed using Pathways, a granular bottom-up energy balance model, with 80 energy demand subsectors and 20 energy supply pathways, modeled separately in each of the nine U.S. census regions. Pathways incorporates a stock rollover model, which makes stock additions and retirements in annual time steps, and an hourly electricity dispatch model. The analysis also used the global integrated assessment model GCAM to develop resource assumptions for domestic biomass use in the U.S. The scenario results shown here are preliminary. The transition to a low-carbon energy system involves three principal strategies: (1) highly efficient end use of energy in buildings, transportation, and industry; (2) decarbonization of electricity and other fuels; and (3) fuel switching of end uses from high-carbon to low-carbon supplies. All three of these strategies must be applied to achieve deep decarbonization, as demonstrated in an illustrative deep decarbonization scenario (main case). Table 3 describes the measures by which these strategies were implemented, and Table 4 shows the quantitative results. Despite a near doubling of GDP between 2010 and 2050, U.S. total final energy consumption declines from 68 to 47 EJ. The result is a 74% 183 reduction in economic energy intensity (MJ/$). Average annual rates of technical energy efficiency improvement are 1.7% in residential buildings, 1.3% in commercial buildings, 2.2% in passenger transportation (in part from switching to electric drivetrains), and 0.7% in freight transportation. For the main case, primary energy supply63 decreases by 24% from 2010 to 2050 (Figure 3A). Petroleum falls from the largest share of primary energy in 2010 (39%) to 6% in 2050, while biomass increases to 26%. Collectively, fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas, with and without CCS) decrease from 92% of primary energy supply in 2010 to 47% of primary energy in 2050. Final energy decreases by 31% over the same time period (Figure 3B). The liquid fuels share of final energy falls from 46% to 9%, while electricitys share of final energy rises from 20% to 51%, and gaseous fuels grow from 28% to 41%. Note: Oil primary energy excludes petrochemical feedstocks. Liquids final energy excludes petrochemical feedstock. Key drivers of changes in CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2050 are shown in Figure 4A. A growing U.S. population (+42% cumulative change between 2010 and 2050) and rising GDP per capita (+87%) are more than offset by reductions in the final energy intensity of GDP (-74%) and the CO2 intensity of final energy (-80%), resulting in an 86% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to 2010 levels. The three largest contributing factors to CO2 reductions (Figure 4B) are: (1) improvements in end-use energy efficiency; (2) a near-total decarbonization of electricity generation; and (3) extensive electrification of end-uses. Two additional measures contribute to reductions but are not shown in Figure 4B: (1) fuel switching to partially decarbonized pipeline gas and (2) the use of CCS for some large-scale industrial gas users. 63 Primary energy is calculated based on the captured energy method, in which electricity generation from nuclear and renewable sources (excluding biomass) is converted to primary energy at its equivalent energy value with no assumed conversion losses, i.e. 1 kWh generated = 3.6 MJ. 184 Note: Final energy intensity of GDP is shown as a proxy for end-use energy efficiency, though structural factors also drive reductions By sector, electricity generations share of CO2 emissions falls from 40% in 2010 to 16% in 2050 (Figure 5). The remaining electricity emissions are primarily from residual emissions not captured by CCS for natural gas- and coal-fired generation. Transportations one-third share of emissions rises to 60% of total final emissions by 2050 (excluding electrified transport), as the remaining fossil fuels in the economy are applied to largely to long-distance transport end-uses (including aviation and military use) that are difficult to electrify or convert to pipeline gas. Industrial direct emissions rise from 15% to 19% of total emissions by 2050, while the residential and commercial sectors are nearly completely electrified, leaving negligible amounts of remaining direct emissions. Note: 2010 totals based on modeled data. These emissions are 1% larger than EPA inventory totals due to minor change in emissions accounting approach for certain sources. 185 Decarbonization and fuel switching in the main case are described in Tables 3 and 4 and illustrated in Figure 6, which shows the evolution of final energy supply and demand by sector and fuel type over time. Electricity becomes the dominant component (51%) of final energy supply, more than doubling its 2010 share, due to extensive electrification of end uses across all sectors. Final electricity consumption increases from 14 EJ to 24 EJ (from 3,750 TWh to over 6,500 TWh). Most of this increase results from electrification of industry and transportation (light duty vehicles), while buildings show little net change in total electric consumption as reductions in consumption through electric energy efficiency offset growth from the electrification of new loads. Note: The upper row of this chart shows the change in CO2 emissions intensity of delivered energy by fuel type for 2010 through 2050 (g CO2/MJ is equivalent to Mt CO2/EJ). The middle row shows the composition of delivered energy as it changes over this time period. The bottom row shows energy demand by major end use sector and delivered energy type for 2010 and 2050. Buildings combines the residential and commercial sectors. Liquid and gas here are defined by the primary form in which the fuels are transported. For example, liquefied natural gas used in freight vehicles is transported over gas pipelines, so is included as gas here. To meet demand, net electricity generation grows by nearly 75% relative to 2010, as shown in the middle right panel of Figure 6. At the same time, a gradual shift in the mix of generation sources results in nearly complete decarbonization of electricity by 2050, with a CO2 intensity of 18 gCO2 per kWh (5 gCO2 per GJ), a 95% reduction from its 2010 value. The 2050 generation mix is a blend of 40% renewables (hydro, solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal), 30% nuclear, and 30% fossil fuel (coal, 186 natural gas) with CCS. No fossil fuel generation without CO2 removal remains in the system by 2050. With 34% of generation from intermittent renewables, the combination of 20% gas-fired CCS generation and 6% hydropower, as well as the use of flexible loads such as smart vehicle charging, provide adequate balancing resources for reliability on all time scales. Despite high levels of electrification across sectors, certain end uses remain technically challenging to electrify, especially in industry and long-distance transportation (commercial and freight trucks, freight rail, shipping), where battery electric energy densities appear insufficient for the foreseeable future. Where technically feasible, these end uses are switched from existing fossil fuel supplies (coal, diesel, gasoline, and fuel oil) to pipeline gas as the preferred combustion fuel, including compressed (CNG) and liquefied (LNG) forms. Pipeline gas refers to fuel carried in existing natural gas pipelines, which is partially decarbonized over time using gasified biomass. Biomass constitutes 55% of the pipeline gas supply by 2050, resulting in an emission intensity 60% lower than pure natural gas and more than 66% lower than most petroleum-based fuels. Almost all available biomass in this scenario is converted to gas, rather than liquid or solid fuels, requiring 16.7 EJ of biomass primary energy, slightly less than the 17 EJ maximum limit for sustainable biomass energy use assumed in this study. This scenario assumes that industry employs CCS on-site for approximately one third (36%) of the sectors use of pipeline gas, the residual combustion fuel. The annual CO2 storage requirement for generation and industrial CCS combined is approximately 1,200 MtCO2 in 2050. Solid fuels with uncontrolled CO2 emissions are eliminated in this scenario, and liquid fuels are dramatically reduced, with petroleum product consumption falling by almost 90% from 2010 to 2050. Residual petroleum use is in the transportation sector, where it continues to be used in some light duty and transit vehicles, civilian aviation, and military vehicles and aircraft. See Figure 7A-C for more detail on decarbonization of each end-use sector. 187 Note: Carbon intensity shown in Figure 7 for each sector includes only direct end-use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production. A qualitative description of strategies and assumptions employed across sectors, fuel types, and scenarios is shown in Table 3, organized by the three strategic areas of energy efficiency, energy supply decarbonization, and fuel switching. Energy efficiency options are similar across demand sectors in all scenarios, with variations based on the form of delivered energy and the associated end-use technologies (e.g. electric or internal combustion engine-based drivetrains for vehicles). Energy supply decarbonization strategies vary widely across scenarios based on the type of primary energy used in electricity generation and the amount and allocation of biomass resources (e.g. solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels). Electricity balancing requirements also differ widely depending on generation mix. Fuel switching strategies are closely linked to the supply decarbonization pathways chosen. Table 3.

All scenarios result in the elimination of coal without CCS, a nearly 90% reduction in petroleum use, and natural gas use that ranges from current levels to about 70% below current levels. All involve a large expansion of electricity generation and electrification of end uses and expanded use of biomass up to the limits of sustainability (Table 4). At the same time, the scenarios are not drop-in substitutes. Two key choices(1) the low-carbon sources of energy used to generate electricity and (2) the amount of biomass allocated to energy supplytend to constrain options for electricity balancing, forms of delivered energy, and demand-side technologies, resulting in substantially different energy systems with self-consistent packages of technologies. For example, some scenarios depend on decarbonized pipeline gas and some do not; some require CO2 pipeline and storage infrastructure and some do not; some require continental scale hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure and some do not. The transition pathways for the alternative scenarios are shown in Figures 8A-8C. This scenario is similar to the main case in demand-side measures in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. It differs significantly in the power sector and industry, because CCS is assumed to not be available. The power sector is decarbonized using primarily solar and wind generation, while maintaining the current share of nuclear power in the U.S. generation mix. Balancing on different time scales is accomplished with a combination of flexible loads, battery and pumped hydro storage, a diverse renewable resource mix, and hydro and natural gas generation. Seasonal balancing is accomplished by overbuilding wind and solar capacity and using periodic over-generation to produce hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Hydrogen is produced up to technical limits on the amount that can be transported in natural gas pipelines, and SNG is produced from hydrogen thereafter. These produced gases, in addition to providing system balancing, are inserted into the natural gas pipeline system along with SNG from biomass. In the absence of CCS, this partly decarbonized pipeline gas provides a combustion fuel for industry and transportation. This scenario is similar to the main case in demand side measures in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, but differs significantly in power and transportation. The details of this scenario are highly sensitive to assumptions about CCS capture rates and biomass conversion rates to liquid biofuels. For 90% CO2 capture rates, the upper limit on fossil fuel with CCS as a share of generation mix is about 50% before carbon intensities become too high to achieve decarbonization goals through electrification. Since CCS is used on-site in industry, pipeline gas consists entirely of natural gas, and biomass is devoted entirely to liquid biofuels. In transportation, residual fuel requirements beyond electrification are met with a combination of biofuels and hydrogen produced from steam-reformed natural gas with CCS. 190 This scenario is similar to the main case in demand-side measures in the residential and commercial sectors. It is very different in other ways, being built around production of hydrogen from nuclear generation, which is used in fuel cells that become the main prime mover in both light and heavy duty transportation. Biomass is used both for pipeline gas, which is used primarily in industry, and for liquid transportation fuels. 191 Table 4.

Two key potential resource limitations requiring further study and sensitivity analysis are biomass availability and CO2 storage capacity. Cost reductions for many low-carbon measures are often a function of market transformation and high volume production, but continued R&D is also important in many areas. Two areas of study seem particularly germane to current challenges in low-carbon technologies: (1) electrochemistry and nanotechnology, to develop the chemistries, catalysts, and physical matrices fundamental to improvements in batteries, fuel cells, chemical processes, and CO2 capture; (2) biotechnology and genomics, which are fundamental to advances in cellulosic and algal biofuels, biomass SNG production, and biological hydrogen production. Public support must be unwavering to impel policymakers to implement transformational changes in energy systems over the course of decades. Public acceptance is also a key variable, especially with regard to siting of low-carbon infrastructure. A high nuclear scenario, for example, seems very unlikely without aggressive efforts to restore public acceptance of the technology. Although the results here are preliminary, some near-term priorities for investment, policy, and regulatory decision-making in the U.S. are already clear. For instance, significant improvements in end- use energy efficiencyin buildings, appliances, equipment, and vehiclesare critical to deep decarbonization in the U.S. Many types of energy efficiency measures are already cost-effective but face barriers to rapid uptake due to well-known market failures. In these areas, continued improvement of codes and standards at both the federal and state level are a proven remedy. Additionally, it is clear that low-carbon electricity is the linchpin of deep decarbonization, and here too existing state and federal regulatory mechanisms, from renewable portfolio to emission performance standards, can help hasten the transition. Given the long lifetimes of generation assets, meeting a 2C target by 2050 without stranding assets requires not building new coal generation without CCS. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need for additional R&D to develop low-carbon fuel solutions for industry and freight transport. 195 SLOVAKIA COLOMBIA COUNTRY RESEARCH TEAMS. Australia.

Not for distribution or attribution. 1010 The Global Carbon Budget for 2C  To have a likely (>66%) chance of limiting global warming to less than 2C, the remaining carbon budget is therefore 275 GtC (1000 GtCO2)  Accounting for warming effects of increases in non- CO2 greenhouse gases, reductions in aerosols, or the release of greenhouse gases from permafrost, could further reduce the global carbon budget  The world is adding approximately 10GtC (36 GtCO2) per year to the atmosphere. Under BAU the carbon budget would be exhausted in less than 30 years Preliminary draft for discussion at Beijing LC meeting.

Research and analysis is conducted by 13 country teams comprised of 30 national research institutions (annex) from: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States. Collectively the 13 countries represented in the DDPP account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. DDPP also works in partnership with several international organizations, research institutions, and business associations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Deep Decarbonization Pathway Project has four objectives: I. Prepare practical national deep decarbonization pathways to 2050, consistent with the 2C target, for each of the 13 countries, to help them identify their own cost-effective transition path to a low carbon future. II. Contribute to a positive result of the September 23rd World Leaders Climate Summit in New York, and to a successful conclusion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris in December 2015, by making governments, businesses, and civil society understand how deep decarbonization can practically be achieved in each country. III. Provide analytical platforms in each participating country to conduct additional climate policy analyses. Such work may focus on technology diffusion and innovation, policy frameworks, financing, governance arrangements for implementation, etc. IV. Build an on-going global network of experts and practitioners, by using the pathways prepared as the basis for further work on the implementation of national deep decarbonization strategies, and by applying the methodological tools developed to other countries and regions. Defining Features & Value Added Meeting the challenges of deep decarbonization, to limit global warming below 2C, requires unprecedented problem solving on all fronts: technological diffusion and innovation, infrastructure building and replacement, financing mechanisms and financial regulation, policy frameworks, institutional arrangements, business models, consumer behavior, etc. This problem solving in turn requires the development of practical national deep decarbonization pathways through to 2050, which will serve as the basis upon which countries will organize further work on the actual implementation of deep decarbonization strategies. The DDPP is building on extensive previous work on decarbonization pathways, both at the national and global levels. DDPPs efforts complement other current projects but are also unique:  The national decarbonization pathways will be truly deep, i.e. consistent with the 2C target. Several studies have been looking at emission reduction trajectories to 2050, though in most country-specific studies, the national emissions reductions are usually not enough to meet the 2C target. Implementation of these studies by countries would induce infrastructure and technology lock-ins, and eventually lead to unsafe levels of GHG emissions globally. In the DDPP, participants have agreed to use a limited number of criteria and methodologies to define the 2050 emissions reduction target for their country, including the convergence of per capita and per unit of GDP emissions and other methods, taking into account important national circumstances.  The deep decarbonization pathways will be country-specific. Many global scenarios developed to look at ways to reach the 2C target are considered unrealistic by country experts because they are based on inaccurate assumptions about technology potentials or are incompatible with other national objectives. In the DDPP, deep decarbonization pathways are prepared by country teams comprising one or more local research institutions. The teams use their in-country expert consultations to develop practical pathways from their own national perspective, helping to form concrete policy discussions with domestic policy makers and businesses. local knowledge and organize  The pathway process will be sound and transparent. SDSN and IDDRI lead the coordination unit, but all analytical and modelling work is done locally and structural decision with regards to the project are taken jointly by all country teams and partners. This approach ensures locally owned tools and results that reflect the specific needs of each country, but are part of a globally consistent and coherent approach towards mapping out a 2C pathway. All country teams and partners collaborate frequently on common input parameters, a shared framework for producing the outputs, and exchanging on technology and other assumptions.  The national decarbonization pathways will be practical. A bottom-up technology- economic perspective will complement the typical macro-economic perspective of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models to lay out in great detail the content of deep decarbonization strategies in a transparent manner, supported by off-model quantitative and qualitative analysis. In the DDPP, the national pathways will identify country-specific solutions to the challenges of deep decarbonization, e.g. for energy related GHG emissions. Timeline & Deliverables The DDPP will publish a first report for the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, on July 1st, 2014,to contribute to the preparation of the September 23rd World Leaders Climate Summit. It will include one chapter for each of the 13 countries, plus a summary of the key findings, showing the key elements of deep decarbonization pathways, both globally, and for each country. The DDPP will also publish a second report for the French Presidency of COP21 in early 2015, to provide inputs to the UNFCCC negotiation process. Compared to the first, this second report will include further elements on the implementation these national deep decarbonization strategies. It will provide some recommendations on the policies to be implemented to manage the transition costs of deep decarbonization domestically, and on the technology cooperation and policy coordination mechanisms to be put in place to accelerate to process of decarbonization globally. Current Status  DDPPs inception meeting was organized in Seoul and hosted by the Korea Development Institute (KDI), on October 12 and 13, 2013.  The second meeting was organized in Warsaw, during COP19 of the UNFCCC, on November 18, 2013.  The third meeting was organized in Paris, from January 6 to 10, 2014, and included 3 days of technology roundtables in partnership with the WBCSD, and 2 days of modeling workshop in partnership with the IEA, gathering a total of 120 participants.  The next meeting is scheduled for early April in Paris.

Without the best start in life for all children, there is no foundation for sustainable societies. Young children have the right beyond survival to thrive and contribute to sustainable communities and the workforce. Over one-third of the worlds children under 5 years fail to develop to their full potential due to poverty, poor health including HIV/AIDS and malnutrition, high levels of family and environmental stress and exposure to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, disability, developmental delays and lack of learning opportunities. This has serious human, social and economic consequences for our societies and our goal to achieve prosperity, inclusive social and economic development and sustainability. While significant progress has been made to increase child survival, more needs to be done urgently to address this developmental and learning gap for children aged 0-8 years. School drop out is the highest in first grade, and most children in poor countries and communities are not able to read by age 9. The Sustainable Development Goals provide a unique opportunity to address this gap, building on decades of research showing the lifelong benefits of quality early childhood programs and policies to ensure that a specific focus is placed on the physical, mental and emotional development of young children, their families and environment. WHAT DO WE WANT THE OPEN WORKING GROUP TO DO? 1. Speak out about young children and ECD during OWG sessions  Reference to young children is missing from discussion around the post-2015 goals.. Young children have also largely been absent from stakeholder consultation. It is up to us to ensure that childrens rights and well-being are represented beyond simply child survival, growth-nutrition and access to pre-primary education. 2. Call for targets that cut across the framework  ECD is not a single intervention. It is a comprehensive package of interventions covering health, education, social protection, womens empowerment, nutrition and security which contributes not only to the well-being of children but their families, communities and countries. Further, ECD programs offer an opportunity to bring a holistic and integrated approach to sustainable development. It will also be important to ensure that targets and indicators are disaggregated by age 0-2 and 3-5 years. 3. Highlight good practice in your country  Use this opportunity to champion examples of good practice, cost- effective ECD interventions from your country and explain the benefits of investing early in childrens development. 4. Public advocacy  Encourage stakeholder groups and the public in your country to get behind international efforts to draw attention to the benefits of ECD and sign the online Global Early Years petition. - 1 - INTRODUCTION The UNs Post-2015 / Sustainable Development Goals process aims to build on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to eradicate poverty, promote inclusive social and economic development, and achieve equitable and sustainable access to wealth by all. Whilst these achievements have been significant across a variety of areas, including child survival, new developmental challenges have emerged  particularly, the need to tackle inequality explicitly, to eliminate poverty and to achieve sustainable development. The evidence across multiple disciplines is clear and compelling  investing in young children is the foundation of human and sustainable development. Current and future development goals will only be met if the global community pays attention to the overall development of our youngest members, children 0-8 years, their families and caregivers. It is during the prenatal period and in the earliest years of life that a childs brain and body develops most rapidly and lifelong patterns of behaviour evolve. Not only are ECD programs and interventions one of the most cost-effective ways of improving health, nutrition and educational outcomes, they also empower women, reduce violence, promote environmental sensitivity and can break the inter-generational cycle of poverty and inequality, creating more prosperous societies. ECD encompasses a number of evidence-based strategies include parenting support, early detection and intervention to address developmental delays and disabilities, child care, support and learning, targeted health, nutrition, sanitation and social protection services, good quality pre-school and transition to good quality primary school. Crucially, ECD interventions are not limited to one government department or ministry. They are implemented in partnership with multiple sectors and multiple partners and require government to work across departments for a range of social and economic benefits. Governments should be encouraged to continue to develop comprehensive policies and programmes and commit budgets to early childhood care and education. Our global commitment to young children is enshrined in the Convention on the Right of Children (CRC) and reaffirmed in the 2010 UN Secretary Generals Report on the Status of the CRC and ECD and the Third Committee Resolution. It is an essential part of a rights-based approach to human development that promotes equitable and sustainable development. Creating an environment in which young children and their families can grow up and thrive will help achieve key health outcomes, improve, learning and earning outcomes, promote social justice, advance womens rights and gender equality. - 2 - GUIDING PRINCIPLES The following principles should be applied to guide the future early childhood development agenda: why is it important? Link Child Survival and Child Development The international community has made incredible strides in tackling preventable child mortality. While this focus should not be lost, an effective focus on ECD must ensure children reach their full physical, cognitive, social and emotional development potential. This will enable all children to fulfil their fundamental human rights. Invest Early for Greatest Returns The evidence is indisputable across a number of disciplines including nutrition, health and education. Investing in the well-being of young children has the greatest long-term social and economic benefits to countries and communities. Integrated parenting programs in the 0-3 years, for example, have increased earnings and reduced depression and violence. Raising pre-primary enrolment to 100% in low- and middle-income countries shows benefit-cost ratios, based on school attainment and earnings benefits alone, of between 7 and 15. Prioritise the Most Marginalised ECD benefits all children, but a focus on reaching the most vulnerable and marginalised, including indigenous people, migrants, refugees, minorities and children with disabilities is essential to securing the greatest development gains. Disadvantaged children and their families gain the most from quality ECD programs, but are the least likely to gain access. - 3 - EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND THE OPEN WORKING GROUP PRIORITY AREAS FOCUS AREA EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT POVERTY ERADICATION, BUILDING SHARED PROSPERITY PROMOTING EQUALITY Any goal on poverty reduction must consider its impact on children and their families. ECD policies and programs are one of the most cost-effective ways to break the cycle of inter-generational poverty and inequality, by giving all children, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised access to opportunities, such as social protection, basic services and thus the best start in life and learning. Good ECD also includes quality childcare which allows families to pursue decent work. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION, Malnutrition in all its forms, notably stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, significantly affects a childs ability to fulfil its potential. Access to good quality, combined nutrition and child development programs is key to ensuring the full physical and mental development of children. HEALTH POPULATION DYNAMICS & WATER AND SANITATION ECD includes action to tackle preventable infant and maternal deaths but also must include consideration of child and mother mental health, universal access to reproductive health care, good water and sanitation, and comprehensive treatment of HIV/AIDS. Mothers who are physically and mentally healthy are better able to care for their children. EDUCATION AND LIFE LONG LEARNING Childrens caregivers and their families need to be supported to create an environment in which children survive and thrive. Access to quality comprehensive early childhood care, early learning opportunities and pre-primary provision for all children, particularly the most marginalised and disadvantaged, is essential for preparing children for school, minimising school drop out rates and maximising their future earnings and economic potential. Adult literacy and lifelong learning opportunities are also important for adults with young children. GENDER EQUALITY AND WOMENS EMPOWERMENT Womens health and development is inextricably linked to the health and development of young children. Empowering women and educating girls is key to saving childrens lives, and providing access to early health and care interventions for all children also enables women to access services and re-enter the workplace. SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS Creating safe and protective neighbourhoods to prevent child abuse and neglect and increasing access to areas for play for young children in cities and urban settlements are essential to the development of children. CLIMATE CHANGE Promoting ECD programs can help young children develop awareness about, and build skills to protecting and sustaining the environment. PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES, RULE OF LAW AND CAPABLE INSTITUTIONS A focus on programmes to promote quality ECD and support for caregivers reduces violence against women and children and promotes positive approaches to managing childrens behaviour. . - 4 -  Young Children as a Basis for Sustainable Development Prepared by the Thematic Group on Early Childhood Development, Education, and Transition to Work  Issue Brief February 18, 2014 Children are a common basis for all dimensions of sustainable development. No advances in sustainable development will occur in coming decades without multiple generations contributing to societal improvement. Moreover, beyond sheer survival, children have a right to thrive, develop to their full potential, and live in a sustainable world.1 In this statement we present the rationale for putting children at the center of an integrated set of post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Many have argued that the challenges presented by sustainable development are integrated. Goals in the areas of poverty reduction, health, education, sustainable agriculture and energy, gender equality and social inclusion, and development within planetary boundaries must be tackled together, not separately. An inter-generational vision of societal development must underlie these goals; without this vision for the next generation, there will be no capacity for nations to actually bring about sustainable development. Recommendation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network for Target and Indicators on Early Childhood Development Target: All children under the age of 5 reach their developmental potential through access to quality early childhood development programs and policies. Indicator: Proportion of children receiving at least one year of a quality pre-primary education program. Indicator: Early Child Development Index, based on existing UNICEF and other measures, encompassing childrens development across language/ literacy, numeracy, physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development. The SDSN also recommends disaggregation by age, distinguishing key indicators related to poverty eradication, water and sanitation, social protection, health and the right to development for the ages under one year (infants), 1-4 years 11 months (pre-school age), 5-14 years (school age), and childbearing age. 1 Chan, M. (2013). Linking child survival and child development for health, equity and sustainable development. The Lancet.                                                          381, 1514-1515. 1 THE LINK BETWEEN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Childrens health, learning and behavior during the early years are the foundation not only for later school success and completion, but also their capacity to participate in community, workplace and society. Young childrens growth and development, in addition, is profoundly shaped by the opportunities for learning, education, economic resources and interactions provided by adults  whether they encounter these adults in home, care, service or community contexts. A powerful set of neuroscientific and economic evidence over the last 20 years now shows that early childhood is a critical stage of human development. The foundations of brain architecture and functioning, and subsequent lifelong developmental potential, are laid down in the early years in a process that is exquisitely sensitive to external influence. Early experiences in the home, in other care settings, and in communities interact with genes to shape the developing nature and quality of the brains architecture. The growth and then environmentally-based pruning of neuronal systems in the first years support a range of early skills, including cognitive (early language, literacy, math), social (empathy, prosocial behaviors), persistence, attention, self-regulation and executive function skills (the voluntary control of attention and behavior).2 Each of these skills, measured in early childhood, are predictive of school success and completion; higher earnings; active participation in communities and society; and reduced odds of delinquency, crime, and chronic and non- communicable disease.3 Later skills  in schooling; in employment; in family life -- build cumulatively upon these early skills. Therefore, as the Nobel-prize-winning economist James Heckman has shown, investment in early learning and development results in greater cost savings than investment later in the life cycle.4 THE STATE OF THE WORLDS YOUNG CHILDREN Despite the well-established importance of the early years, each year 7 million children worldwide do not survive to their fifth birthday, and over 200 million children who do survive                                                         2 Learning Metrics Task Force (2013).

These 200 million children thus face high odds of early mortality; school failure; early pregnancy; joblessness; and chronic and costly diseases across the lifespan.7 This represents an enormous and perhaps the primary challenge to global sustainable development. THE EVIDENCE ON ESSENTIAL EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND POLICIES To address the growing challenges of environmental crises, poverty and inequality, and domestic and armed conflict, a transformative approach to early childhood development is required. In low-, middle-, and high-income countries alike, ECD services encompassing proven approaches to health, education, social protection and child protection are some of the most cost-effective interventions for a range of long-term outcomes important to society, including completed schooling, higher lifelong earnings, and reduced crime.8 These programs begin before birth and include comprehensive family planning, complete birth registration, and a package of proven health services encompassing preventive and curative care.9 They include nutrition programs that integrate an emphasis on supporting stimulating and responsive parenting, a combination of services with powerful effects on both health and learning.10 By preprimary age, they include quality learning and education programs, whether                                                         5 Grantham-McGregor, S., Cheung, Y.

These solutions to maximize childrens future contributions sustainable development are available and known: we refer the reader to recent reviews of this strong and extensive evaluation science base.11 The economic benefits of investing in young children globally are well-established. Quality preprimary education has been shown to produce substantial economic benefits, including higher rates of primary and secondary completion, higher earnings in adulthood, and lower crime.12 Raising preschool enrollment to 50% in low- and middle-income countries has been estimated to result in benefits of over $33 billion US, with a benefit-cost ratio of between 7.8 and 17.6, depending on the discount rate.13 A nutrition and parenting stimulation intervention for infants and toddlers resulted in impacts 20 years later in raising IQ; reducing anxiety, depression and violence; and increasing earnings by 50%.14 Such services contribute substantially to a broader development agenda to fight poverty and inequality.15 Not acting on these proven solutions -- not integrating them into progress on global targets and indicators -- will thus have substantial costs to societies. The SDSN Thematic Workgroup on Early Childhood Development, Education and the Transition to Work has put forward a target and indicators that reflect the comprehensive nature of early development across physical, cognitive, language, socio-emotional domains and realize childrens rights to their full developing humanity (see sidebar).16 Governance and                                                         11 Engle, P.

A transformative solution: Reducing poverty and inequality through a global early childhood development goal.  4 implementation approaches to assure that the evidence-based programs to support these outcomes also exist to guide nations to ensure maximum results on their investment in young children.17 In addition to these indicators specific to young children, it is critically important that indicators tracking the entire range of sustainable development goals be disaggregated by age (early childhood; primary school age; secondary school age; the transition to adulthood; child-bearing age and beyond). Without this disaggregation, progress towards sustainable development for the most vulnerable cannot be measured. For example, stunting is well- established and difficult to reverse by age 2. Rates of household poverty are the highest for families with young children, and harmful effects of poverty are also largest when experienced in the early years.18 Without disaggregation by age of poverty indicators, the impact of social protection on the most vulnerable will be unknown. Similarly, efforts to increase gender equality; reduce population burdens on the planet; provide improved water sources and sanitation; and prevent HIV infection all have particularly powerful and long-lasting influences between birth and school entry. Disaggregating indicators by age must therefore distinguish the birth to 2 and 2- to 5-year age periods, in addition to primary- and secondary-school ages. The large number of the worlds children starting life at severe risk and experiencing toxic stress threatens all other goals of sustainable development.19 The capacity of a nation to build sustainable systems and infrastructure, innovate and invest in technology, and grow while reducing impact on the earths resources all depend on a workforce with the skills that are foundational to productivity, civic engagement, and innovation. Not pursuing an early childhood development goal, moreover, would not only compromise achievement of all other sustainable development goals, but also violate the right of every child to develop to his or her potential. It is for these reasons that children must be at the very center of the Sustainable Development Goals.                                                         17 Vargas-Barn, E. (2013).

Introduction and context Educating children and enabling them to be productive, fulfilled individuals who can live life to their full potential is the first responsibility of every society. The global education community has long recognized both, the inequities that arise from denying children access to high quality education, and the slow pace of its spread across the world. Starting from the World Declaration on Education for All, the United Nations system and its member countries have adopted and reiterated their commitment to the goal of universal education for all.1The Millennium Declaration recognized this as an unfinished task of the new age, asking each country to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education.2 This two decade long global effort has yielded real results- with access to primary education expanding rapidly across the world during this time. Enrolment and literacy rates have improved, and there has been a gradual movement towards convergence of access-mostly between girls and boys- but also across linguistic, cultural, ethnic, class, and geographic disparities. Yet, the improvement is greatly uneven and we are not even close to being able to provide every child with the quality of education she or he needs to participate effectively in our society. As the world moves towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) deadline of 2015 and begins to ponder on the next set of global objectives, the challenge of enabling every child to access the right to universal quality education remains. Several inter-governmental processes are underway that are helping define the post-2015 development agenda. Many of these efforts reflect wide ranging consultations with civil society organizations, in- country conversations with policy makers, children, educationists and political leaders. Many reflect the experiences of the past five decades of goal setting and global policy discussions around education. All have produced valuable insights on the state of education, and the immediate priorities of the coming decades. A few such efforts are particularly relevant for the goals related to children and young adults: The Report of the High Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post 2015 Development Agenda called for a global consensus around a single sustainable development agenda, with a specific focus on quality education and lifelong learning.3The report of the Global Thematic Consultation on Education has proposed a similar focus on equitable and quality education and lifelong learning.4 The UN Global Education First Initiative calls on countries to prioritize putting every child in school, to improve quality of learning, and to foster global citizenship5. 4 The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) is a collaborative network launched by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accelerate practical problem solving for sustainable development and to support the framing of the development objectives for the next two decades. This report has been prepared by the Thematic Group on Education as an input to the ongoing global policy dialogue. It focuses on how best education interacts with both the challenges, and the solutions for sustainable development. It offers a departure from some of the other reports by focusing on all children and adults, especially in their earliest years. Like some other reports, it emphasizes the need to focus on a broad set of learning outcomes to guide policy design and performance. It hopes to inject a sense of urgency in efforts to reach all young people, and focuses especially on innovations in learning content, delivery channels and quality improvements, arguing strongly for well-funded high quality educational systems that focus on improved outcomes for children, be they in the space of early cognitive and physical development, better and more relevant learning, or preparedness for work and life. 1.1 Making the Case Education as a Fundamental Right Education is an important right in itself. The right to education has been recognised since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Article 26 of the Declaration stated that Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsoryeducation shall be directed to the full development of human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.6Subsequently, the right to education was reiterated in several international conventions such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966), the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC, 1989), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006). Today, many countries, drawing from the international treaties, have established the right to education as a basic right within their national constitutions.7 Education for Sustainable Development The SDSN fully supports the Rio+20 vision of sustainable development as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions of society1: economic development (including the end of extreme poverty), social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and good governance including peace and security. Societies 1 The Rio+20 outcome document refers to three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental) and good governance, which is sometimes described as the foundation of sustainable development. For simplicity we refer to the four societal objectives as dimensions of sustainable development. 5 aim to achieve all four dimensions. Failures in one area, such as environmental sustainability or gender equality, can undermine progress in others, such as the eradication of poverty. Poor governance and insecurity can all too easily undermine progress on economic, social, and environmental objectives.8 Dimensions of sustainable development: economic development Education at all ages is a critical element of achieving sustainable development in all its dimensions. A good quality education is the basic weapon to end extreme poverty and its inter-generational transmission; and long-term economic growth depends on an educated and healthy population. Other aspects of extreme poverty- such as improvement in health outcomes-are intrinsically linked with behaviour change-brought about in large part through public and community education. The large number of the worlds children that start life at severe risk  over 200 million -- threatens the global goals of poverty eradication, sustainable development and social stability.9Available benefit-cost evidence suggests that early childhood development (ECD) interventions of sufficient quality could reduce that number and thereby contribute substantially to a nations future workforce and its active participation in community and society. Existing research shows three types of ECD interventions with evidence of cost effectiveness: a) health interventions shown to reduce maternal and infant mortality; b) parent-directed programs for 0-3 year olds with a combined focus on breastfeeding, complementary feeding and nutrition, and early stimulation and responsiveness; and c) pre-primary education. Parent- directed interventions for disadvantaged mothers with at-risk children showed evidence of cost- effectiveness.10 Quality pre-primary education in high-, low- and middle-income countries is associated with large benefit-cost ratios, estimated as 6 or larger in recent studies.11 This happens in several ways: first, investment in ECD programs and policies, coordinated across education, health, and social protection, raises the ceiling of developmental potential at the individual, community and national levels. Second, because effective ECD requires building the capacity of health, education, and protection systems, and across private and public sectors, it can form the basis for integrated approaches to sustainable development. There is substantial evidence to show that countries with better educational outcomes have improved demographic and health indicators. A higher level of education, especially among women, has been shown to contribute positively to demographic change- it increases the age of marriage and child survival, and improves awareness of forms of contraception, leading to lower levels of fertility and overall rates of population growth.12 Increased levels of education are also linked to improved health outcomes, as measured by falls in mortality rates, risk reduction of chronic non communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and a fall in morbidity-related work days; in most studies, the effect 6 of improved education on health is the greatest in the low and middle income countries.13 Additionally, there is a strong inter-generational effect of education, both in terms of healthier children, but also in terms of better educational outcomes for second-generation learners.14. Dimensions of sustainable development: social inclusion Education enables children at all ages to learn far more than basic literacies- to learn values of civic behaviour, social justice, global citizenship, and skills of critical reasoning, innovative thinking, interpretation, socialization, self-direction, and creativity; making them more likely to form communities that are economically and socially inclusive- thereby building the social capital for a sustainable future. During the consultation processes for The World We Want, a clear goal that was articulated was for all youth and adults, particularly girls and women, to have access to post-secondary learning opportunities to develop knowledge and skills, including technical and vocational, that are relevant to work and life and necessary for further learning and forging more just, peaceful, tolerant and inclusive societies. Moreover, quality ECD services can reduce inequality. Across many studies, the positive impacts of ECD on child outcomes are strongest for the most disadvantaged; this suggests that ECD can be an effective approach to reducing social and educational inequality.15 A recent estimate, based on data from 73 low- and middle-income countries, indicated that $196 billion in lost productivity was associated with the educational attainment gap for 15-19 year olds between the richest and poorest quintiles. In low-income countries, these estimates suggest that this attainment gap could be cut in half by increasing pre-primary enrolment to 50% (i.e., from the current average of 15% to 50%).16 Dimensions of sustainable development: environmental sustainability Support for learning in early childhood can create participatory processes of children and adults for ecosystem conservation and innovations in care for the environment. In all aspects of implementation of ECD programs and policies, protecting the natural and cultural diversity of environments can be integrated with curricula, standards and practice. The future of our planet depends on investments in research to develop new technologies, use of renewable energy, ways of reducing greenhouse emissions, and better management of our forests, ecosystems, and oceans. Preparing scientists who can undertake this research and push the frontiers of sustainable scientific inquiry will depend on investments in higher education. It is important to highlight the fact that education can assist in the process of shifting the global demand away from resource- and energy-intensive commodities and toward greener products and technologies, sustainable lifestyles and less pollution. Thinking critically, solving problems, collaborating and 7 managing risks and uncertainty are core competencies that are critical for employment in a green economy and living together peacefully in a sustainable society. Moreover, since the effects of climate change are already being felt, the education sector can also play a critical role in teaching relevant skills for successful climate change adaptation and mitigation. Teaching and learning these 21st century skills should integrate environmental education, climate change and scientific literacy, disaster risk reduction and preparedness, and education for sustainable lifestyles and consumption. Conversely, sustainable development policies can play a transformative role in child and human development. For example, environmental toxins can wreak especially potent damage on life-course health in the first years of life, when neuronal development is at its most rapid and plasticity, or the sensitivity of growth and development to external influence, is highest.17Efforts to reduce environmental toxins can benefit growth and development. Dimensions of sustainable development: good governance (including peace and security) Sustainable development is impossible without good governance; including peace and security, but going far beyond, to create a society that governs itself in a transparent, rules-based manner, and where its members have a common understanding of its shared objectives and collectively uphold the rule of law. Education is a vital element of a strategy to build governance structures that are effective, fair and sustainable. The empirical experience of developed countries illustrates more clearly what the economic literature is attempting to show: investments in large scale public education have nurtured and sustained economic growth and well governed societies. The more recent examples of East Asia have been widely discussed in the development literature and show the consistent economic and social rewards that East Asian countries (starting with Japan in the late 19th century, and including South Korea, and more recently China) have reaped from an early focus on creating an educated population.18 Most of todays education systems are not truly designed to ensure the breadth of learning that will be needed for sustainable development. In order for learning to achieve impact on societal sustainability, it has to spill over multiple contexts and age groups. In this report we present a vision of education that is based on the right of every child, parent and adult to access quality learning opportunities across their life span to build a common and better future for their societies. 8 2. A Global Report Card 2.1 Trends across enrolment and completion at different levels of education, 1990 and 2010 Pre-primary enrolment rates across the developing world are low and scattered (Map 1). Rates are marginally higher for boys as compared to girls, with an improvement especially in middle income countries since 1990. Yet fully 85% of children in low-income countries had no access to pre-primary education in 2010. Regionally, 83% lacked access in sub-Saharan Africa and 78% in the Arab states. Levels of public spending on pre-primary education, expressed as a percentage of public spending on education, were less than 5% in over 50% of countries with available data in the 2000s.19 As for other indicators of early childhood development available across the majority of the worlds countries, there have been notable declines in absolute poverty for children under 5 in the South Asia, East Asia, and Latin America / Caribbean regions, with some exceptions, but declines have been much smaller since the 1990s in other regions. The highest rates of young child absolute poverty are in sub- Saharan Africa (46% in 2006).20The story is somewhat similar regionally for stunting by age 5, with substantial declines in South Asia, East Asia and Latin America / Caribbean, and rates in 2010 highest in South Asia (36%), Southeast Asia (27%) and sub-Saharan Africa (45% in eastern Africa; 39% in middle Africa).21 Map 1: Gross Enrolment rates for girls and boys, pre-primary levels, 1990, 201022 9 Over 60 million children are out of primary school today, with half of them in sub-Saharan Africa, and about 13 million in South and West Asia. Of these, 53% are girls, totalling 16 million in sub- Saharan Africa, and 7 million in South and West Asia. At the secondary level, there are 70.5 million adolescents out of school, with nearly 31 million in South and West Asia, and over 21 million in sub- Saharan Africa. Figure 1: Out of School Children by Region Primary enrolment rates reflect the real success of education policies over the past 2 decades (Map 2); they have expanded rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, for boys and girls since 1990.

What does a shift from a Business As Usual (BAU) Scenario mean? There are three different ways of thinking about shifting away from Business As Usual. First, in its most literal sense, business as usual DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON would imply a scenario where countries continue with historical policies, investments, and programs that lead to incremental changes in overall outcomes of access and quality. The first shift from business as usual would therefore imply a break from historical trends and norms; this was the scenario that the Millennium Development Goals aimed to bring about- by urging countries to accelerate progress in access and completion of primary education. This first shift from BAU focused mainly on primary education and the challenges of creating an inclusive, publicly funded, high quality education system that brought all children into the schooling system. As the previous section showed, over two decades of effort in this direction has yielded significant improvements in enrolment and completion. Yet, several of the original challenges remain. Public education systems remain severely underfunded in many countries, making it impossible to make the basic investments in infrastructure, teachers, and learning materials that are needed. Millions of children still remain outside of the schooling system. In many countries as the previous section maps show, completion and transition to post primary education remains very low. The first path away from Business As Usual therefore, will require completing, with a renewed focus, the promise of universal primary education. 13 The second, related shift away from Business As Usual will need to focus on the quality and reach of the overall education system.2Most countries have equated the opening of schools and appointing of teachers with ensuring access. Yet the agenda of universal access is not complete until learning occurs universally. At the primary level this means a much stronger emphasis on what children are learning from teachers and peers in classrooms. Evidence shows that national learning indicators move slowly, even in relatively high performing countries.24 This requires not just ensuring that children are physically in school, but focusing on the way teachers are trained, the content of the curriculum and learning materials that students are expected to learn, and the pedagogical tools teachers employ to help children achieve learning outcomes. At the post-primary level, children in many low- and middle-income countries are not able to complete a full course of basic and secondary education and reach a level of learning where they are ready to enter tertiary education. Access to secondary education is also much poorer- in much of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, enrolment rates are less than 50 percent. Secondary education is much more expensive than primary- required investments per child are estimated at two to three times those at the primary.25 The level of training of teachers and the quality of infrastructure is also much higher and more specialized. The tertiary education system is out of bounds for most children in developing countries today. It is extremely difficult to compare learning outcomes of educational systems across DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON countries. There are very few globally comparable standards or tests that allow for such comparisons. The partial evidence that does exist, through cross-country standardized tests such as PISA, show large variations within and between countries. The limited data that does exist does not project an optimistic picture. Current trends indicate that over half of developing countries with learning data from standardized tests such as PISA would take over 30 years to achieve OECD learning levels. In the case of selected sub-Saharan African countries, reaching OECD levels would take over 130 years (Table 1). 2The six EFA goals highlighted the pathways for exactly such a shift towards comprehensive, quality education across all level of the system. 14 Table 1: Catching up to OECD levels for PISA and SACMEQ tests, selected countries DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON Modified and reproduced from Beatty and Pritchett 2012 This second shift away from Business As Usual would therefore require two components: a focus on improving learning at the primary level, and learning from the experience of primary expansion to think about post-primary expansion in a way that combines the twin objectives of learning and access. But as we saw in Chapter 1, even if these two shifts from Business As Usual occurred, they would not necessarily create an education system that prepared children and young adults for the world that we are entering into. The challenges of sustainable development require a population that is trained not just in basic numeracy and literacy, but in advanced cognitive skills, in analytical skills, and in social, cultural, civic and emotional skills; it requires a population that invests in children at birth-long before 15 PISA scores improvement (2000-2009)ReadingMathematicsPoints per year gain (loss if neg)Years to reach score of 500Points per year gain (loss if neg)Years to reach score of 500Argentina-2.22Forevern/an/aBrazil1.75514.9723Chile4.4211n/an/aIndonesia3.45281.8669Mexico0.372045.5515Peru4.7328n/an/aThailand-1.03Forever0.27304Tunisia (2003)4.84202.1360Turkey (2003)3.8793.6715Uruguay (2003)-1.36Forever0.7795Median2.6322.1338SACMEQ scores improvement (2000-2007)Botswana1.93801.09155Kenya (1995)-0.02Forever-0.9ForeverLesotho2.39924.2450Malawi (1995)-2.43Forever2.01120Mauritius (1995)1.94595.5312Mozambique-5.81Forever-6.6ForeverNamibia (1995)1.99965.7338Seychelles-0.99Forever-0.51ForeverSouth Africa0.375211.24156Swaziland2.83493.4743Tanzania4.56244.3331Uganda-0.53Forever-3.49ForeverZambia (1995)-3.59Forever0ForeverZanzibar (1995)3.97381.69118Median1.151501.46134Country (year if not 2000) they enter schools; it requires a productive and skilled workforce that can respond to the needs of a sustainable society; and it requires a society that regularly upgrades and reinvests in its own people at all ages to build new competencies. Table 2 shows that even economically prosperous countries today are not entirely ready for these challenges. While education systems respond to the challenges of primary, secondary, and tertiary access and learning, they do not respond systematically to the need to prepare young infants for life, or prepare young adolescents and adults for work or citizenship, or adults for lifelong learning. Some of these new challenges can be addressed through existing structures- but some will require innovations in design and delivery models.

We argue that they require a much broader and faster set of actions than in the past, and will need for educationists, policy makers, civil society, parents, and communities to come together build a sustainable future. 3. Upcoming challenges: the scale and scope of problems Despite the diversity in cultural and economic contexts, education systems across the world have followed a remarkably similar structure for the last 2 centuries: they open their doors to children between the ages of 4 and 7 years, adopt similar systems designed to transfer knowledge across 5-6 subjects spanning language, arithmetic, basic sciences, and social studies for the next 12 years. This knowledge is transferred from the teachers to students through a similar set of pedagogical tools in classroom groupings ranging from 20 to over 100 students. Teachers are identified through pen and paper exams and trained to have subject matter knowledge and pedagogical expertise to varying degrees. In most countries teachers are also de facto role models for young children, introducing them to norms of social and cultural behaviour and values. Schools provide safe havens to children for 6-8 hours a day, where they are sorted by age, and are exposed to academic studies, to sports, and to varying degrees, social skill building activities. Standardized exams at the end of the schooling cycle DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON then test children for their knowledge and preparation for higher education. Tertiary systems of education are also remarkably similar. Students either prepare for professional degrees, or liberal arts and natural sciences, or vocational skills (not available everywhere) that sort them for the occupational specializations of a post agricultural, largely industrial society. This description, though crude, approximates reality across countries in the world today. It underlines the greatest purported value of education systems  the offer of a level playing field, and the promise of social and economic mobility. They help create a large pool of labour with common skills. They have proven to be resilient and effective ways of bringing in massive numbers of children from diverse backgrounds together for a common socialization process. These systems have been replicated across the world, starting from a base in Northern Europe in the 1700s, and today form a mostly unquestioned core edifice of society. Today over 1.2 billion children are enrolled in formal systems of schooling worldwide- the largest number and the highest proportion of children ever in the history of humankind26. The differences across education systems in different countries are also significant. The first difference is that of resources: estimates show that countries in North America and Western Europe spent approximately US$7,900 per pupil as compared to US$263 per pupil in South and West Asia, and 17 US$134 per pupil in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education in 2010 (PPP adjusted constant 2009 prices).27The second difference is in the way teachers are identified, trained, supported, and treated by their employers, their community and the parents of the children they teach. Finally, there are significant differences in how curricula are designed, how learning is assessed, and how standards are determined and maintained. All of these differences explain to varying degrees, the wide variation in educational outcomes across countries. Looking forward towards the next fifteen years, there are four societal changes that can affect education systems. First, a growing young population in much of the Arab World, South Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa, among other regions, is a challenge when coupled with growing aspirations of the population that is more literate and getting increasingly familiar with economic growth. Not only will more children need more primary schools but as they complete primary education, there will be much greater demand for secondary, vocational, and tertiary education. Second, in most parts of the world, people are becoming more mobile and urban. Higher rates of mobility are becoming the norm not only within countries, but also across countries. This means that planning for educational expansion will require taking into account forecasts of rapidly shifting populations, and differential shifting rates by demographic structures. DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON Third, the old definitions of literacy of simple ability to read and count are no more sufficient. Of course there is enough evidence from different parts of the world that indicate that even this basic literacy is not imparted effectively. But going beyond basic numeracy and literacy, there are several other types of basic literacies that are critical. Digital literacy and financial literacy are becoming essential to participate in globalizing economies. Health and safety hazards come in many forms now not only in public places but at home too. Science literacy and Math literacy are a growing need for all ages. Fourth, technology is changing our individual and collective lives dramatically in all its aspects  economic, political, and social- to varying degrees around the world. The communication revolution has created immense possibilities, but it is also throwing challenges of making judicious choices in a deluge of information. As degrees of individual freedom grow, it is important to learn to become individually and collectively responsible for sustainable growth at all levels of human society. Information and communication technology can be an important ally in expanding access and improving quality. However, to equate this with merely placing computers in classrooms will be a grave error. The essence of the ICT revolution is that it allows free flow of information and knowledge which is also characterized by random access to it. As more and more children, adults, and parents seek access to 18 the massive human collection of knowledge, we need to consider systemic barriers to access to knowledge and how the population, especially in the developing world can be enabled to overcome these barriers. The world of education is already experimenting with new tools (such as online learning, flip classrooms, and MOOCs). For now, this is largely in the domain of the more academic sphere of learning. In the developing world, there is relatively little understanding of the ways in which technology can serve to improve educational outcomes in practical and immediate ways. Finally, as we work towards creating sustainable development goals, the complex web of problems that will need resolution will require skills, knowledge and contributions that exceed the current capacities of most education systems- both in the developed and developing worlds. In the next section, we highlight the four broad challenges that emerge from the societal shifts described above (Figure 2). They reflect, both, the unfulfilled agenda of the Millennium Development Goals, and the new responsibilities of creating global citizens that can continually participate in learning. Figure 2: Schema of Emerging Challenges DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON 3.1 Continuing inequalities of access and participation: Over the last few decades, despite expansion, education systems have not been able to reach out to the most marginalized and vulnerable children-who in fact are likely to be their biggest beneficiaries. Children do not enter the schooling system on an equal footing- their gender, social and political environments, family background and income levels, location and access to schools, and ethnicity, all play a role in determining not just access but also how well they are able to learn and cope in formal 19 EmergingChallengesProviding universal access to quality basic educationOpportunities of ICTDisruptive possibilitiesChanging role of teachers and communitiesGovernance structures21stcentury skills, learning competencies, social and emotional learningMath, science, financial and technical literacyEducation for sustainable developmentAdult and multigenerational learningRemoving inequities of access and participationEnsuring adequate funding where countries are under-resourcedInnovating in delivery channelsFocusing on quality and relevant learning outcomesPlanning for dynamic and rapidly changing population flowsFocusing on young children and adults-traditionally not part of education systemsAdjusting for evolving demographics schools. In many countries, education systems are systematically under-funded-making it difficult for them to garner the additional resources needed to reach every girl and boy and retain them in school. Girls face systemic challenges Evidence shows that despite recent progress, gender matters immensely. In most developing countries girls face significant domestic responsibilities, ranging from caring for siblings and sick relatives, to collecting firewood and water, often requiring several hours of walking a day, to helping in domestic tasks of cooking and cleaning, leaving them with much less time to attend school. Even if attendance is high at the primary level, once girls reach puberty, schools often cease to be safe places for them. Separate toilets, access to sanitary towels, and safe routes to and from school are largely absent. Parents are much more reluctant to send girls to school through their adolescent years. Consequently, girls are systematically less likely to continue on to secondary school than boys; in 2010, the enrolment ratio of girls to boys was 97% at the primary level, compared to 27% at the secondary level in sub- Saharan Africa. For South and West Asia the girls-to-boys enrolment ratio was 105% at the primary level, compared to 43 % at the secondary level.28 Children in conflict settings face huge disruptions in access to schooling Of the 60 million out-of-school children, nearly half (28 million) live in conflict or post-conflict situations DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON where they face multiple barriers- apart from lack of access, they face physical danger in their quest for education; psychological damage from proximity to, and often forced participation in violence affects cognitive and emotional development; and the uncertainty of war disrupts education even when it is available, leading to interrupted learning. On average, the primary enrolment rate falls by 9% while the secondary enrolment rate falls by 29% in countries that face conflict.29Children in post conflict and fragile states need special attention and resources. The state education systems in these countries do not have the resources to create these additional facilities (for example, regular counselling, remedial programs for children who have missed school, etc.). Access to education is harder in rural areas Physical location matters- children that do not have a school in proximity to their homes, or do not have safe transportation paths are often unable to attend with regularity. Twice as many children in rural areas are likely to be out of school than children in urban areas, and adult literacy rates are significantly lower in rural areas as compared to urban areas (Figures 3, 4). Figure 3: Adult literacy (15+years) by urban and rural populations for selected countries30 20 Children from poor and socially discriminated backgrounds are the hardest to reach Low family socio-economic conditions are the greatest barrier to access. Four times as many children from the poorest income quintile are likely to be out of school as compared to those in the top quintile (Figure 4). This is for several reasons; the most direct link is with affordability; in the absence of free schooling, parents struggle to afford to send their children to school. Financial vulnerability also increases the risk of drop out- and the ability of formal systems to bring back children who may temporarily have to leave for part of the school year (for example, during harvest times or seasonally for DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON nomadic populations. Parents of children from low income homes have a higher probability of being poorly educated- leaving them both unable to communicate effectively with teachers, and to support their children when they struggle at school. Economic compulsions cause many children to drop out at secondary school level, in order to supplement family incomes. In such cases, children do not have the flexibility of distance learning or flexible hours of schooling at a high quality. Children from socially marginalized groups, tribal communities, or low castes are often marginalized within the education systems as well by teachers and their peers. Children from linguistic minorities face significant hurdles to learning. When the medium of instruction is in a language different from what children speak and learn at home, they face a double barrier--that of learning itself and of learning the language of learning.

Schools are not built to allow easy access to children with physical disabilities; teachers are not trained to handle the learning requirements of children with cognitive challenges; formal systems of education have standardized curricula that children in these circumstances find hard to follow, and there are few cases where adaptation is easily possible and encouraged. As a result, the disparity between disabled and DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON non-disabled children continues to be large Figure 5: Differences in completion rates for disabled vs. non-disabled children All of the barriers described above are possible to bring down- but they require a high level political commitment to reach every child, demonstrated by adequate financial resources to build a robust education system, and flexible, adaptable systems to reach out to children who are especially vulnerable. 22 0510152025303540TotalMaleFemaleUrban RuralRichest QuintileSecond Richest Middle QuintileSecond Poorest Poorest Quintile(% out of school)Average Out-Of-School Rate By Individual And Household CharacteristicsReproduced from \"ReachingOut-Of-School Children Is Crucial For Development\" -UIS Fact Sheet ,June 2012Based on Household Survey Data from 30 countries 2003-2010MaleFemale50.60%41.70%61.30%52.90%Primary School Completion (%)Disabled Not DisabledReproducedfrom World Report On Disability. Publication. World Bank And WHO, 2011. 3.2 The expanding target group for education The implications of evolving demographics: The demographic profiles of the developed and developing worlds are widely different (figures 6 and 7).31 Figure 6: Population structures in developed countries by gender, 2015 and 2030 The majority population in developed countries will be in the 40-70 years age groups by 2030. Of this DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON population, nearly all will have gone through school education and nearly two-thirds will have gone through some form of vocational or higher education in its youth. This population will be part of a global work force competing with younger, more recently skilled workers from other countries. As societys needs evolve, its citizens will require new knowledge and skills to meet those needs. Yet, the largest share of the population in these countries does not currently have structured access to means of acquiring these skills over their working lifetimes. Figure 7: Population structures in developing countries by gender, 2015 and 2030 23 In comparison, by 2030, the majority of the developing world population will be in the 0-25 years age groups. The largest increases are estimated to be in 2 age categories: 0-25 years, and the 30-45 years age groups. In todays terms, this population comprises children ranging from those yet to be born to those who are currently 8-10 years of age; and those between 15-30 years of age. Both these age groups will determine the productivity, the social structures and the civic fabric of their societies. These demographic shifts are dramatic and have profound implications for the scale and nature of education needs that will emerge. They point to the need to not just prepare todays children, but create ways of enabling women and men of all age groups to acquire the tools necessary to be productive citizens. Figure 8 demonstrates the gap in todays educational architecture: The current system (defined by the bars representing current enrolments) reaches only a quarter of the population, and in the case of developing countries, reaches less than half of the 0-4, and the 15-24 years population segments. In the case of the school going population, the figure camouflages the realities of inequitable access and poor quality- that despite the physical access-fail to deliver on the promise of education. Figure 8: The limited reach of the education sector, 2015-2030 DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON The implications of this gap are clear: first, the focus of education cannot be on the primary school age group alone (5-14 years). In developing countries, the 0-4 years age group, and the 15-24 years age groups are where the coverage gaps are highest over the 15 year period. In developed countries, while current coverage levels are high, the majority of the population will be in its late working age- without the means to acquire new, competitive skills. In both cases, systems of learning have to become more open to young children and adults. The importance of early childhood learning and development: Why does the 0-8 age group matter? Today, 7 million children worldwide do not survive to their fifth birthday, and over 200 million children who do survive do not reach their developmental potential in early childhood, as indexed by either stunting or exposure to absolute poverty.32 Risks such as 24 maternal malnutrition or poor mental health; lack of recommended breastfeeding; lack of access to clean water and sanitation; lack of learning opportunities; and exposure to violence lead to this loss of human potential.33 Such experiences can get under the skin, overwhelming the bodys stress mechanisms and immune functions. These 200 million children are at high risk for school failure; early pregnancy; joblessness; and chronic and costly adult diseases.34The large number of the worlds children starting life at severe risk and experiencing toxic stress threatens the goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development.35 Today, traditional systems of education are not designed for children below 5 years- most are dependent largely on household and informal care. They require support for their early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development, which is especially rapid in the years that the foundations of brain architecture and lifelong learning are being built. Because the kind of care needed at these ages requires coordinated attention from health, education and social protection sectors, formal education systems cannot act alone to support early childhood development., Even if we consider only the constrained task of providing pre-primary education in centers, most formal education systems have been unable to integrate pre-primary care systematically into their structures. The need for adult non-formal and continual education opportunities DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON Out of school children, illiterate men and women, or adults who dropped out of school are not targeted by formal education systems, in a systematic, high quality manner. While most countries have structures for non-formal and continuing education, the quality of curriculum and teaching, the effort towards outreach, and the flexibility offered to students is highly variable, with generally poor outcomes and extremely low coverage. And yet, adult learning (especially for women) is critical not just for its own sake, but because it has multiplier effects on households and communities. As described above, parental literacy is a significant predictor of student performance; it can also improve parenting, especially parents ability to support their learning. Additionally, as the demographic forecasts show, the 15-30 years age group today will be the largest population cohort in 2030. Given low rates of secondary and tertiary enrolments, the majority of these men and women are not highly educated-the ability of countries to reach out to them through continual and remedial adult education will be critical to bring them into civic and economic activities, and to maximize their potential to contribute to sustainable development. In many countries this cohort may be larger than the cohort enrolled in primary and secondary schools. This will require a significant effort to scale up adult education, and most developing countries are not prepared for such an expansion. 25 3.3 What are children and adults learning? Most formal systems of education focus on numeracy, reading and writing skills. They do not systematically measure or even recognize a broader, more ambitious set of learning outcomes. Skills of analysis and critical reasoning, innovative thinking, interpretation, and socialization are not recognized systematically as required and basic skills that students must acquire to complete their education. Learning is not just about math and literacy; it encompasses social and emotional learning and 21st century skills  teamwork; organizational skills; autonomous learning; self-direction; creativity; innovation; etc. These are the priorities not only for students, but for their teachers, their parents and all adults who come in contact with them. Learning also encompasses the much wider range of contexts and individuals  most importantly adults  parents, teachers, community members  in workplaces, households, community settings. Low levels of basic numeracy and literacy skills Estimates suggest that over 250 million children around the world lack the ability to read, write and count- despite being in school for four years or more36. The inability of governments to ensure basic literacy and numeracy skills at the primary school level, despite an unprecedented expansion in schooling per se, is the single greatest challenge facing basic education. While most countries have DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON managed a significant and often rapid expansion in access to classrooms and teachers, this has not translated into improved learning levels. At the post primary level, the path is even steeper. The precedent of wealthy countries shows that average learning outcomes improve slowly at the national level, and based on the experience of wealthy countries, improving learning outcomes through the traditional route of increased expansion of formal schooling will take decades if not centuries37. Poor learning levels in emerging cross-country assessments at the secondary level The evidence on learning outcomes across the developing world is scattered, but what we know is dramatic and worrying. There are still relatively few instruments of globally comparable assessments that we can to use to learning levels across countries. Since the first internationally comparable student achievement tests began through the First International Mathematics Study (FIMS) in 1964, just over 12 international tests have been conducted globally, culminating in the recent Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) exams. These tests cover math, science and reading for 3 age/grade groups: primary education (ages 9-10), lower secondary education (ages 13-15) and the final year of secondary education (grade 12-13). Most of the countries in the PISA and TIMSS samples are high or middle income 26 countries.38Even within this limited set of countries, a few patterns are clear: first, among developed countries, there is a poor correlation between education spending and learning outcomes; second, most middle and low income countries rank consistently low in these tests (with the exception of parts of China and other East Asian countries); third, within developing countries, over half the children tested fail to clear the lowest level of the tests (as compared to less than 22 percent in average OECD countries). In the absence of data on a wider set of learning and well-being outcomes, these results are far from the final word on cross-country learning outcomes.39 But they are an important first glimpse into the global competitiveness of developing country education systems. Over the past few years a number of research and advocacy efforts around the world have turned the attention of educationists and policy makers to the question of learning outcomes and life skills that are critical to enable children to lead productive, fulfilling lives. The Learning Metrics Task Force is a global effort hosted by the Brookings Institute that is aiming to define learning and measurement standards for children around the world. The Task Force is in the process of defining a much broader concept of learning-characterized under seven domains of learning- that we return to later (see Chapter 6 for a more detailed discussion). Basic numeracy and literacy skills for adult women and men DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON Just under half of all adult women and thirty percent of adult men in low and middle income countries are illiterate.40 The inability to read and write hampers these women and men in multiple ways: it prevents them from engaging with the economy in any way other than basic manual work, thus limiting their lifelong earning potential; it exposes them to risks of exploitation it prevents them from exercising their basic rights as citizens and community members; it restricts their ability to be effective parents and provide their children with a learning environment; it hampers their ability to access public, financial, and other social services; and most importantly, it creates a crisis of confidence which holds them back from using their talents and skills to their maximum potential. National adult literacy programs have had limited success in reaching and teaching women in particular-creating an unsustainable gender imbalance. While women need basic numeracy and literacy, they are not sufficient by themselves. Transforming adult literacy programs into broader adult and continuing education programs with exposure to financial, health, and digital literacy is now essential. Education for sustainable development: The world will face new and more complex challenges over the coming decades. Global warming and its attendant consequences in the form of changing weather patterns, shifting agricultural production 27 and new health risks, together with burgeoning populations, rapid urbanization, and rapidly diminishing natural resources will bring in the need for new skills, especially in the developing world. These skills simply do not exist today-developing new technologies for managing alternate sources of energy, developing sustainable modes of living, developing sustainable models of food production, building and managing resilient urban infrastructure, protecting and adapting to natural disasters, preventing and treating new diseases are some examples. Higher education systems across the developing world are not prepared to provide these skills- and primary and secondary education systems are not prepared to build the foundation skills that support them. Understanding the needs of society for sustainable development and creating solutions that work will require working closely with policy makers, public organizations and private companies and to train people who can implement these solutions at scale. As the global economy adapts to climate change, new green occupations will emerge. More and more jobs are expected to come up in renewable energies, environment and new technologies. The transition to a green economy will not only change the profile of the new labour demand, but will also change the scope and nature of existing jobs. Significant research is needed to assess the impact of greening economies on skill needs. The transformation, although slow, will affect skill needs in various ways, including through structural changes in the economy generated by the gradual shift to a green output, which will lead to new enterprises and to the technological change of existing ones. Certain jobs will DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON disappear and new ones will emerge, and the education sector will need to adapt rapidly-through changes in content, qualification standards and training programs. All of these changes will require that education systems prepare ahead of the change peak in the real economy, anticipating needs and giving time to learning processes to properly empower new comers with knowledge and skills. Preparing young people for work Young women and men coming out of school do not have clear pathways to work. Remediation is a first challenge for those that have dropped out before completing school; 40 percent of the students enrolled in lower secondary drop out by the last grades of secondary school- and work in the informal sector.41Identifying ways in which they can be taught skills that allow them to earn a decent livelihood or be self-employed will be an immediate challenge for most countries. Their inability to meet it will not just create an unfulfilled, potentially destabilizing large group of young people, it will forego the promise of a demographic dividend that would otherwise create the platform for social and economic prosperity. Formal vocational or school-to-work programs reach a small fraction of young people between the ages of 15-24 years. Existing programs are designed for industrial and some service-sector work (technical vocational work such as plumbing, electricians, mechanical skills, or basic computer and language 28 skills). Yet a much wider set of skills will be needed for the kind of jobs that will emerge in the coming decades-skills that reflect the ability to work in teams, organize information, adapt to rapidly changing environments, solve problems, and be innovative. These skills cannot be taught in short after-school programs; they need to be embedded in education from early childhood onwards, and need to be continually renewed with lifelong learning. Preparing adults for work in a globalized society The costs of tertiary education are rising rapidly, making it increasingly unaffordable for middle and lower income students; at the same time, the content of tertiary education is failing to keep pace with the evolving needs of society and the economy. Difficult economic conditions point to a related paradox: a perceived shortage of job skills across the world combined with high unemployment rates among young people. In the developing world, gross enrolments are around 18percent.42 In the developed countries, there is a mismatch between the education provided, and the skills demanded by employers- over 40 percent employers blame skills shortages for entry level vacancies.43 At the same time, over half of student graduates do not believe that their post-secondary education improved their employment opportunities. Over the next decade and a half, these economic opportunities will evolve more rapidly than before. DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON The world is more interconnected today than ever before- this means that contagion effects will be much stronger in the future- as already seen in the global economic slowdown since 2008. Countries will need to adapt rapidly to changing economic fortunes, and growth sectors within national economies will shift. The spread of information technology has fundamentally altered the profile of skills needed for different kinds of work. Knowledge accumulation no longer commands the premium that it did before the advent of the internet. Interpretation, analysis, and management of knowledge and its application to the world are much more valued skills. Increasing automation in manufacturing is another irreversible trend. Both of these together imply that the content of education at the secondary and tertiary levels will have to change, with an emphasis on building abilities to manage environments, technology, and people at different levels of complexity. At the same time, developing countries need skills to manage food production and enhance farm productivity, to look after local and national natural resources, to manage health needs of their population, and organize their societies needs for energy, water and basic services. These skills are in short supply as well, and unlike in the formal economic sector, they cannot be easily imported. Traditional knowledge in these areas is kept out of formal education systems-but will be invaluable in preparing young people to take on community leadership roles. 29 3.4 Challenges of delivering education to children and adults Are education systems geared towards lifelong learning? The current centralized model of teaching is ill-equipped to enable the kind of learning required by different groups; in the case of children in the under 5age group for example, integrated health, educational and social interventions require a combination of effort from the family, community and public services across sectors. At the school level, a focus on learning a broad set of skills will fundamentally change the role of the teacher; and training for work and higher studies will require close coordination with future employers. The paucity of teachers and their changing role: Successful education systems revolve around the teacher as critical for learning. Countries that are unable to deploy a cadre of highly skilled, motivated teachers struggle to achieve high quality. Challenges start from the point of selection- globally there is an estimated shortfall of 4.3 million teachers, of which 2 million pertains to sub-Saharan Africa alone.44These numbers do not include the need to replace teachers who retire, the gaps at pre-primary or secondary level, or the need to train and develop the large numbers of untrained and under-qualified teachers who are already in post. Countries face different, yet equally critical issues several lack selection systems that can identify, DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON develop and support high quality teachers. In many countries, teaching was once a coveted and socially respected profession- with widening economic and social opportunities its role in the occupational hierarchy has declined. Teacher training institutions vary dramatically across countries, but share some common features: curriculum is infrequently revised, especially to keep pace with the rapid changes in the economic and social structures of society; the role of teachers is seen as transmitters of knowledge, not enablers of learning; teachers are not taught to cope with the variation in childrens backgrounds and learning levels; and once teachers graduate, there is often little follow up once teachers enter the classroom, either through mentoring and support, or through continuing learning. Once teachers enter the schooling system, they often work in high stress environments-very often with large and multi-grade classes, with very poor supporting infrastructure. There is a large gap between the theoretical instructions provided to teachers during their training and the realities of the classroom that they struggle with each day. Further, as enrolments have risen rapidly in many countries, there is a large number of para-teachers with much lower qualifications and training than regular teachers. This has raised the urgent need to expand training opportunities, innovate around training models, and have ways to continually support the professional development of teachers in the classroom. 30 Teacher pay varies across countries, and there are few incentives (financial and non-financial) that reward efforts to improve learning outcomes for students45. More importantly, teachers systematically lack an enabling and supportive environment at work- one that encourages and rewards innovations in the classroom, which offers practical support for specific in-class challenges, which creates a mentoring system where new teachers can learn from their more experienced colleagues and one where the skills and knowledge base of teachers is continually upgraded. In most countries, teachers are also seen as the last mile providers of State services- in conducting surveys for example-which take away from their teaching obligations. Despite these challenges, most teachers perform heroically in the classroom. Contributing to these teacher quality problems is a gap in education leadership, starting at the head master or principal level and including higher district to subnational levels. In many countries this position is attained solely through seniority. The competencies that make for effective school-level leadership are usually undefined in systems. The lack of specialized training and professional development for education leaders across dimensions of organizational, instructional and family and community leadership contributes to the lack of school-level supports for teachers to engage in their own learning and improvement. It is also critical to develop shared and distributed leadership in schools contributing to teachers self-efficacy and collaborative capabilities.46 A broader role for parents and communities DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON Most systems of education usually ignore the role of parents and communities, both in determining the content and purpose of education, and in their roles in its effective delivery. First generation learners have significantly lower learning outcomes, pointing to the potential of parents and families, with adequate support to create a nurturing environment for learning, and be a powerful lever for sustainable development.47 A new generation of support that reflects models of inter-generational and adult learning is missing. Education systems do not yet adequately recognize that learning takes place not just in schools, but also at home, and among peer groups, and opportunities to structure learning across these settings need to be encouraged. A focus on a broad set of learning outcomes will require that parents participate in efforts to support learning. They can also participate in efforts to evaluate teacher performance, demand greater accountability and participate in school decision-making. On their part, schools will need to engage networks of parents to spread learning that begins in school across villages, neighbourhoods, and communities. More systematically, discussions of the purpose of education, the pedagogy and the curricula exclude parents and the wider community from where the students come. In the case of developing countries, the design and content of the education system has been imported from a Western model that is often 31 at odds with the realities of societies and the traditional knowledge, skills, and modes of instruction of the communities that students come from. The first example of such a divergence occurs in the medium of instruction- when children learn in a language that is not their local dialect or mother tongue, it makes learning more difficult. The second example is in the context of the subject matter, which rarely refers to the realities of the childrens lives. The third example is in the kind of skills that children are expected to learn which are often not referenced to the needs of their communities or families. These forms of disconnect also mean that education is a finite, static phenomenon that children enter into and exit from, without continuing it through the rest of their lives, without allowing for learning in adulthood, and without allowing for the lessons of adulthood to inform the learning experience. The role of the State: Traditionally the content and design of education has been the preserve of the public sector-partly because of its role as a basic public good; partly because of the State viewing it is as an instrument to build citizenship and common social values; and partly because of its potential as an avenue for social and economic mobility, requiring it to be accessible by all children regardless of ability to pay. Indeed, there is no example of a country with high educational outcomes where the provision of basic education has been in the private domain. The massive expansion of educational access across the developing world in the post colonialism era (starting from 1950) followed this pattern as well, as evidenced by DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON patterns of public expenditures on education across the world. Much of the developed world spends approximately 5 percent of GDP on education (slightly lower or stagnant from 1970s levels); low income countries, by contrast spend approximately 3 percent of GDP on education (up from 2.5 percent of GDP in 1970). Public education systems are now under threat across several countries in the developing world. Two separate phenomena have emerged within a context of an increased demand for education during the last decade: first, the mushrooming of private schools, including so-called low-fee private schools, to meet the demand for quality education across large parts of South Asia in particular (where nearly one third of children in rural areas attend private schools)48. Second, there is a proliferation of after-school tuition classes that are privately arranged, in South and East Asia to supplement in-school learning. Both these phenomena find reflection in a rising share of the private sector enrolments especially at the secondary level (see Figure 9 below). Figure 9: Growth of Proportion Privately Enrolled at Primary and Secondary Levels by Region 32 Source: EFA Global Monitoring Report Database 2012 Both these phenomena have led to several implications: first, in countries with significant private enrolments (private enrolment rates greater than 10 percent of total), an increasing proportion of teaching is now happening outside of the public schooling infrastructure- this means that any efforts at improving quality will have to engage both the public and private sectors. Second, parents are spending a significant share of their income on private education-this has a substitution effect (creating further household impoverishment with corresponding reductions in household spending on either health or nutrition or other basic goods). Moreover, households who are unable to cover the costs for education for all their children may prioritise the education of their boys. Third, it leads to a reinforcing cycle of DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON deteriorating quality within the public system, which ends up catering to only students from the most deprived households, or in the most remote regions that have no other options. Fourth, the development of a parallel commercial market for education is likely over time to milk the best resources out of the public system, leading to further deepening of inequalities in the provision of education. Fifth, the quality of private education is highly variable-evidence shows that private schools do tend to outperform public schools (but not after controlling for the socio-economic background of students and the level of autonomy enjoyed by private schools).49In the case of post-secondary education, the State is largely responsible for undergraduate education, while the private sector is becoming a significant player in vocational, technical and professional education. A basic challenge that will arise will be to balance the role of the State as the main provider of basic education, with demands that exceed its existing capacities. This will require systemic improvement in the quality of education provided by the State, through a combination of resources and better governance-a slow process that will need tremendous political foresight and will; it will require rebuilding trust in the quality of public schooling, not just amongst the poor, but amongst the middle and high income families as well. Finally, it will require imagination to create new and creative ways of reaching students with quality education regardless of their existing mode of instruction- a theme that we return to in section 6 in more detail. 33 DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON 34 4. Goals for the next two decades 4.1 Context: Since education was declared as a basic human right over six decades ago, many efforts have been launched to deliver this right to every child in the world. In 1990, over 150 governments came together to adopt the World Declaration on Education for All at Jomtein, Thailand to set global goals for education. Ten years later, 180 countries met at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal and adopted six Education for All Goals. The Millennium Development Goals, set in 2000 were a broader set of goals with two that focused specifically on education (Table 3). Table 3: International Education Goals (1990-2015) DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON International goals aim to bring together political commitment, backed by policies, financing and legal frameworks so that the right to education can be actualized by every child. Global trends of educational enrolments have been improving steadily-with a distinct upturn in South and West Asia and sub- Saharan Africa since 2000. It is not possible to credit this upturn in both primary and secondary enrolments to the adoption of International Goals alone- improvements reflect rising demand for education, greater prioritization of education within countries, access to greater resources-and yet, the goals have helped bring about all of these factors as well (Figure 10). 35 Figure 10: Historical trends (and projections), 1995-2030 4.2 Post-2015 Development Agenda: Consensus on Quality and Lifelong Learning As the post-2015 Development Agenda takes shape, there have been many proposed goals for education- all of which recognize the centrality of quality and learning as national objectives. The High Level Panel of Eminent Persons, in its report proposes the following Goal and Targets on education: Provide Quality Education and Lifelong Learning. Targets include: 3a. Increase by x% the proportion of children able to access and complete pre-primary education; 3b. Ensure every child, regardless of circumstance, completes primary education able to read, write and count well enough to meet minimum learning standards; 3c. Ensure every child, regardless of circumstance, has access to lower secondary education and increase the proportion of adolescents who achieve recognized and measurable learning DRAFT NOT FOR CIRCULATI ON outcomes to x%; 3d. Increase the number of young and adult women and men with the skills, including technical and vocational, needed for work by x%. The Global Thematic Coalition on Education has proposed a similar goal on Equitable, Quality Education and Lifelong Learning for All. 4.3 SDSN Leadership Council Education Goals Recommendation The SDSN Leadership Council has proposed an education goal and three accompanying targets as part of the next set of goals focused on the challenge of sustainable development, reflecting the emerging challenges discussed previously. The SDSN proposal differs from existing proposals on 3 counts: first, it recognizes the gap around early childhood development and the comprehensive nature of interventions that would be necessary to ensure that all children receive the support they need at the beginning of life; second, it emphasizes learning effectiveness as the central measure to define success at all ages; and third, it focuses not just on academic or employment related skills, but learning for the sake of creating citizens who can participate in building a sustainable world. GOAL 3: ENSURE EFFECTIVE LEARNING FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH FOR LIFE AND LIVELIHOOD 36 All girls and boys complete affordable and high-quality early childhood development programs, and primary and secondary education to prepare them for the challenges of modern life and decent livelihoods. All youth and adults have access to continuous lifelong learning to acquire functional literacy, numeracy, and skills to earn a living through decent employment or self-employment. The SDSN Leadership Council has also proposed 3 targets to underline the goals (described below). In addition, the SDSN Leadership Council has identified a core set of indicators linked to each target that constitute the minimum set needed to measure progress towards the Goal. A detailed description of all the goals, targets, and indicators can be found in Annex 1. Along with the core indicators, an additional set of tier 2 indicators are proposed which can be modified and implemented at the national level. Target 3A: All children under the age of 5 reach their developmental potential through access to quality early childhood development programs and policies.3,50 Proposed Core Indicators:  Proportion of children receiving at least one year of a quality pre-primary education program.  Early Childhood Development Index Tier 2 Indicators  Proportion of children under 5 experiencing responsive, stimulating parenting in safe environments.  Percentage of pupils enrolled in early childhood development programs receiving providing basic drinking water, adequate sanitation, and adequate hygiene services. Target 3B.All girls and boys receive quality primary and secondary education that focuses on learning outcomes and on reducing the dropout rate to zero.  Primary completion rates for girls and boys  Percentage of girls and boys who master a broad range of foundational skills, including proficiency in reading and foundational skills in mathematics by the end of the primary school cycle (based on credibly established national benchmarks)  Secondary completion rates for girls and boys  Proportion of girls and boys who achieve proficiency across a broad range of learning outcomes, including in mathematics by end of the lower secondary schooling cycle (based on credibly established national benchmarks) Tier 2 Indicators: 3Developmental potential encompasses physical, cognitive, social and emotional domains of learning and development. 37  Proportion of girls and boys who acquire skills and values needed for global citizenship (national benchmarks to be developed) by the end of lower secondary school Target 3C. Ensure all youth transition effectively into the labour market  Youth employment rate, disaggregated by formal and informal employment.  Tertiary enrolment rates for young women and men Tier 2 Indicators  Proportion of adolescents (15-19 years) with access to school-to-work programs  Percentage of young people not in education, training, or employment  Percentage of young adults (18-24 years) with access to a learning program  Proportion of young adults (18-24 years) who are literate Achieving these goals will not be easy. The previous Chapters outlined the challenges that need to be addressed, and this Chapter proposed the goals that would be required to guide the work of the education sector over the next decade and a half. In the subsequent 3 chapters, the report outlines the actions that will be required to achieve these goals-combining the evidence from programs and policies across the world, and matching the evidence to the kinds of research that will be required to allow countries to track indicators to measure progress towards the goal of education for a sustainable world. 38 5. Supporting early childhood development for children from 0 to 8 years Children are the common basis for all dimensions of sustainable development. No advances in sustainable development will occur in coming decades without multiple generations contributing to societal improvement. Moreover, beyond sheer survival, children have a right to thrive, develop to their full potential, and live in a sustainable world.51Childrens health, learning and behavior during the early years are the foundation for later school success and completion, close nurturing relationships with peers and adults, and the capacity to participate in community, workplace and society. Young childrens growth and development, in addition, is profoundly shaped by the opportunities for learning, education, resources and interactions provided by adults  whether they encounter these adults in home, care, service or community contexts. Early childhood is thus a critical stage of development -- it is a culmination of learning for one generation embodied in the beginning of a lifetime of learning for the next. To address the growing challenges of environmental crises, poverty and inequality, and domestic and armed conflict, a transformative approach to learning  lifelong, inter-generational, and encompassing health, cognition and behavior is required.52When we consider the learning life course in this way, the need for integrated approaches that include but are not limited to the traditional education sector becomes apparent. This life-course perspective also draws attention to the need for education for sustainable development with an emphasis upon global interdependence and civic responsibility starting early in life. In this section we synthesize the science of global early childhood development in order to identify how a focus on early childhood development can contribute to societal transformation and sustainability. 5.1 How Early Childhood Development Occurs Definitions of early childhood vary in different countries and regions, according to local traditions and the organization of primary school systems. In some countries, the transition to primary school occurs soon after 4 years old. In other countries, this transition takes place at around 7 years old. We define early childhood as the period of human development from prenatal through the transition into the early primary grades, 0-8 years of age.53 The subsequent section of this report covers education from 5 to 18 years of age; the overlap is intentional, as early primary education can benefit from extension of principles of effective, holistic early childhood development. The foundations of brain architecture and functioning, and subsequent lifelong development, are laid down in early childhood in a process that is exquisitely sensitive to external influence. Early 39 experiences in the home, in other care settings, and in communities interact with genes to shape the developing nature and quality of the brains architecture. The growth and then environmentally-based pruning of neuronal systems in the first years support a range of early skills, including cognitive (early receptive and expressive language, early literacy, numeracy and math), social and emotional (theory of mind or perspective taking, empathy, pro-social behaviors, self-regulation), and executive function (voluntary control of attention and behavior) skills.54In addition to health and physical development, each of these skills, measured in early childhood, is predictive of school success and completion; higher earnings; active, positive participation in communities and society; and reduced odds of delinquency, crime, and chronic and non-communicable disease.55 We define developmental potential to encompass indicators of physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development during early childhood. Later skills  in schooling; in employment; in family life - - build cumulatively upon these dimensions of developmental potential. Therefore, as the economist James Heckman has argued, investment in learning and development during early childhood results in greater cost savings than investment later in the life cycle.56The capacity of a nation to build sustainable systems and infrastructure, innovate and invest in technology, and grow while reducing impact on the earths resources all depend on a workforce with the skills that are foundational to civic engagement, creativity and productivity. The period of early childhood is critical in this regard. There is a direct link between developmental potential in early childhood and a nations potential for sustainable development. Early childhood development (ECD) programs and policies have been defined as a comprehensive set of policies and programs for children from the prenatal period to eight years of age, their parents, their caregivers and their communities. Their purpose is to uphold the childs rights to develop his or her full cognitive, emotional, social and physical potential.57 Investments in ECD programs and policies with essential quality features support these rights, and substantially increase the odds of children reaching their developmental potential.58 With commitment and participation from the national to the local and community levels, and across government and civil society, such programs and policies can substantially add to a nations social and economic potential. In low-, middle-, and high-income countries alike, ECD programs and policies such as the ones we review below are some of the most cost-effective interventions for a range of long-term outcomes important to society, including completed schooling, higher lifelong earnings, and reduced violence and crime.59Many of the recommended maternal and infant health interventions from the prenatal to age 3 period show evidence of cost-effectiveness. The combination of nutritional (breastfeeding and 40 complementary feeding) and parenting support from birth to 3 years has produced long-term, life- course increases in educational attainment and earnings. And raising preschool enrollment to 50% in every country has been estimated to result in benefits of over $33 billion US, with a benefit-cost ratio of between 7.8 and 17.6, depending on the discount rate.60Such programs and policies can contribute substantially to a broader development agenda to fight poverty and inequality, and to ensure that all children reach their developmental potential.61 Despite the well-established promise of investing in the early years, 7 million children worldwide do not survive to their fifth birthday, and over 200 million children who do survive experience severe risk, as indexed by either stunting or exposure to absolute poverty.62 Risks such as exposure to environmental toxins; lack of access to clean water and sanitation; maternal under-nutrition; poor maternal mental health; lack of recommended breastfeeding; lack of learning opportunities; and exposure to violence lead to this loss of human potential.63 Such experiences have lifelong consequences for health conditions and disease; school progress; employment; and the ability to participate in community and society.64 5.2 The Evidence Base on ECD Programs, Policies and Systems Given the current status of the global evidence base, which interventions in the early years show the most promise of ensuring that all children reach their developmental potential in early childhood? How can they be implemented in the context of diverse communities and national systems in ways that fulfill that promise? We synthesize the evaluation literature and future directions across six major themes intended to support the achievement of Target 3A and the other ECD-related indicators of the SDSN in the next 15 years: an integrative approach to health and learning; supporting parenting and early childhood education; social protection, workforce development and non-formal education; social inclusion for the most vulnerable; measuring early childhood development to track progress on Target 3A; and effective implementation of programs and policies to support the target. When evidence on particular ECD themes relates to indicators for other goals, we reference those indicators. Achieving Target 3A through Integrative Health, Nutrition and Learning Interventions Associated Indicators for this theme: Beyond the indicators for Target 3A, material in this section relates to indicators under other goals, particularly when disaggregated for the early childhood period, as the SDSN recommends. These other indicators include those associated with Goal 1 (prevalence of stunting in children under 2 years of age; 41 proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption; and proportion of population with shortfalls of essential vitamins, iron, iodine, folates), Goal 2 (unmet need for family planning); Goal 4 (birth registration coverage), Goal 5 (percent of population with access to emergency obstetric care; proportion of children fully immunized; proportion of TB cases; proportion of population with advanced HIV infection; proportion of malaria infections addressed by timely diagnosis and treatment; incidence and death rates associated with malaria; under-5 mortality; infant mortality; maternal mortality rate), Goal 6 (proportion of rural population with access to improved water source; proportion of rural population with access to improved sanitation), and Goal 7 (proportion of urban households with access to safe, sufficient drinking water; proportion of urban households served by safe sanitation services; proportion of urban households with access to regular solid waste collection; percentage of sewerage and wastewater treated). Recommendation: Assure universal access to reproductive health care, including comprehensive prenatal screening, education and health care visits that include preparation for delivery, parenting support and family planning options. 1.2.2 Recommendation: Provide nutritional supports for pregnant and lactating mothers and appropriate breastfeeding and nutrition education (exclusive breastfeeding before 6 months of age and complementary feeding together with nutritional supplementation beyond 6 months of age). Recommendation: Provide universal, regular immunisations; comprehensive child screening and treatment; and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions with education for all families. An integrated approach to help young children not only survive, but thrive, has emerged recently in global health.65 Key interventions in the areas of family planning; maternal and newborn health (antenatal care and birth attendance); immunisation (e.g. measles, BCG, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus); and preventive and curative care are the basis for maternal and child survival.66 An integrated set of interventions, delivered beginning with intrapartum care in health centers / clinics, is the recommended approach.67 Successful interventions can follow and supplement these services throughout the early childhood years in other settings, such as community- or center-based care settings. Interventions to address maternal and child survival that integrate an emphasis on learning  both for the parent and for the growing child, through mechanisms such as promotion of stimulating and responsive interactions  have substantial added benefits. An important and proven example is the combination of breastfeeding / nutritional supplementation interventions with parenting support. Programs to increase exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months followed by complementary feeding 42 and nutrition supplementation after 6 months increase child micronutrient intake and health, and reduce infant mortality. Nutrition interventions from 0 to 3 years of this type not only reduce stunting, but also raise later school performance and even earnings.68When components targeting cognitive stimulation and responsiveness during feeding are embedded in nutritional supplementation interventions, positive effects on parents and on child health and cognitive outcomes are even stronger.69One intervention of this type in Jamaica had remarkable effects 20 years later, as participants reached young adulthood: reduced anxiety, depression, and violent behavior; and increased educational attainment, earnings and IQ.70 The Care for Child Development of UNICEF and the WHO responds to this strong evidence base by embedding these practices within large-scale health and nutrition systems.71 The key in effective parenting interventions is not so much the setting  effective models have been implemented in a huge variety of community settings as well as homes, health clinics and workplaces  but an emphasis on rapport between the facilitator and the parent, and feedback with opportunities for modeling and practice with the child.72 Preventive and curative health services are critical components of ECD services, yet many show low coverage. All can benefit from coordination with education. Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for pregnant women and the use of insecticide treated nets, for example, showed coverage rates averaging 11% in 37 nations with endemic malaria in 2010.73Advances in prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs have produced impressive reductions in infant transmission (between 2000 and 2009, a 24% reduction of incidence in the 25 countries with highest incidence in 2000). Implementation of the WHOs 2010 guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (including extending ARV for both mothers and infants) would reduce incidence further by 79% and be highly cost- effective.74Food fortification and vitamin A, iron/folate and MMS supplementation; and interventions to prevent and treat diarrheal disease, such as hygiene interventions, deworming, and zinc supplementation, are also proven strategies to reduce health problems that can be integrated with childrens care and learning programs, preprimary education, and family-and community-based interventions.75 For example, since children of preprimary age very often have younger siblings,76 the provision of programming to support the health of children birth to 5 can be integrated into preprimary education. An important dimension of preventive services that can be integrated with universal health interventions in infancy and early childhood is screening for developmental delays. The identification of children with special health care needs in the first years of life includes attention to learning delays, not just physical health and behavioral delays.77Linking intervention to such screening results is vital to actual 43 improvement of developmental potential for these children. Ensuring that children identified through screening receive effective services and access to ECD programs and policies, across health, education and social and child protection, will do much to advance the currently often deplorable abandonment, neglect and institutionalization of children with disabilities in early childhood.78 System and infrastructural improvements contribute not only to sustainability but also to child survival. WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) interventions are effective in reducing risks for diarrhoea and attendant morbidity and mortality. A recent meta-analysis of program evaluations showed that water interventions of two types  those that create new clean water sources, and those that address water quality at the source or at the point of use  reduce diarrhoeal disease. Hygiene interventions, providing education and encouraging hand washing, and the provision of sanitation facilities similarly show positive effects on diarrhoeal as well as asthma and other respiratory diseases.79 However, median coverage of sanitation and diarrhea treatment was 41% in 68 countries with Demographic and Health or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data in 2010.80Finally, the use of clean cooking fuels, rather than traditional biomass-burning cookstoves, can reduce disease and death due to respiratory problems.81Here again the integration of health and education is of great importance: Point of use interventions require effective education, which is particularly critical for pregnant mothers and parents with infants and young children. 5.3 Achieving Target 3A by Enriching Parenting and Early Childhood Care and Education Associated Indicators for this theme: Beyond the two primary indicators for Target 3A, material in this section relates to the Tier 2 indicator for Target 3A (proportion of children under 5 experiencing responsive, stimulating parenting in safe environments), as well as indicators under Goal 4 (violence against children, including physical punishment or abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect) and Goal 5 (depression treatment coverage). Learning is a multi-generational enterprise in early childhood. Regardless of the setting  the childs home; a village communal space; a social network of parents; a media-based interactive environment; or an out-of-home care or pre-primary education setting  childrens learning is largely built through interactions with caring adults and peers. These may be parents or other family members; caregivers in out-of-home care settings; other parents in the community; or teachers. Learning and development in early childhood are supported by the sum total of caring adult and peer interactions that a child encounters in the settings of daily life  home; child care; and early childhood education.82 Only through 44 attention to all the settings of early childhood can developmental potential, and subsequent sustainable development, be assured. Supporting a young childs development is thus a community responsibility that requires and benefits from opportunities to increase adult learning. Four sets of adult caregiving roles and skills are causally related to growth in childrens physical, cognitive, social and emotional development: adult and parent health and adequate nutrition; caregiving and parenting; adult and parent well-being and mental health; and skilled instruction in quality educational settings.83 We reviewed programs targeting parent health and nutrition previously; here we review successful approaches targeting the other three factors, as well as future directions for innovation on these fronts. Supporting caregiving and parenting skills. Parenting programs to support caregiving stimulation and other parenting skills show positive effects, given sufficient intensity and quality.84They may be particularly important when access to other forms of learning opportunities (e.g., early childhood education) is very low or non-existent. Recent evidence suggests the benefits of encouraging caregiving roles and skills that are both culturally and developmentally specific. Although the developmental importance of responsive caregiving has been established across many cultures, for example, there is variation in the forms that reciprocal, responsive interactions in caregiving can take, depending on the developmental stage of the child, the specific settings of family and community life, and values and beliefs of what constitutes successful development.85 For example, cultures vary in the extent to which interdependence vs. autonomy are encouraged in childrens relations with one another and with adults. Successful programs balance these foci in ways sensitive to the ecological and cultural context. A parenting program in Turkey with long-term effects intentionally integrated interdependence and autonomy with sensitivity to child needs in its parenting approach. This was done in accordance with the particular sociocultural and historical context of the low-income families and communities the program served.86 As childrens behavioral and cognitive capacities become more complex over the first 5 years of life, their integration into family and community life changes in nature. Successful programs are contextually sensitive to these changes.87 Programs to improve parents or caregivers interactions with preschool-aged children, for example, have emphasized to different degrees the reduction of acting-out or aggressive behaviors; the encouragement of autonomy and initiative; or the inclusion of those who are excluded from social interactions.88 45 Recommendation: Implement parenting programs that incorporate opportunities for practice with feedback; curricula; peer support; and ongoing training and supervision for facilitators. Parenting programs are more effective when they incorporate curricula; ongoing training for facilitators; practice and feedback; and opportunities for peer support and community building.89 Approaches to training and professional development for those who provide caregiving and parenting support to parents -- health educators, home visitors, community parents  are showing evidence of success. For example, an intensive, two-year professional development and education program for community mothers engaged in home-based care in Colombia produced increases in observed quality of caregiving as well as child health and behavior.90 A program in Pakistan tailored the Care for Child Development module to provide intensive professional development and supervision to community health workers, encouraging responsiveness and stimulation in mothers interactions with their children, in the health workers interactions with the mothers; and even the interactions of the trainers with the health workers, many of whom had relatively low levels of education. Positive effects were observed on caregiving as well as childrens cognitive, language, and motor skills at ages 12 and 24 months.91 Intensity may also matter in parenting programs, with one meta-analysis in the U.S. showing few benefits for children when the number of visits or contacts was 3 or fewer.92Finally, effective programs often incorporate a peer support or community building emphasis. The building of community-level social capital can be an important outcome of parent-focused ECD programs.93 Recommendation: Assess and reduce rates of maternal depression with treatment and preventive interventions. Supporting parent mental health. Parent mental health problems, especially perinatal and postnatal maternal depression, have severe consequences for very young childrens nutrition, cognitive, and social and emotional development.94 Depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.95 Few large-scale programs have been established to treat maternal depression in low- and middle-income countries. One recent intervention, providing training to community health workers to implement short cognitive-behavioral therapy-based intervention to mothers with postpartum depression in Pakistan, produced large reductions in rates of depression a year later.96 Some early childhood interventions have produced long-term decreases in depression among participants followed up into adolescence and adulthood.97 In addition, social protection programs and policies, which can reduce economic worries and stress and bolster parents abilities to provide for their young children, may reduce levels of mothers depressive symptoms in the short run.98 Thus, prevention of parental depression may be possible through human capital and economic interventions. 46 Recommendation: Ensure that all children start school on time and acquire basic competencies by age 8, across cognitive, social, and emotional domains. Recommendation: Assure safe and responsive caregiving arrangements for children under 3 Recommendation: Ensure quality in early childhood care and education, whether in centers, preschools, or day-care settings, through comprehensive standards and effective pre- and in-service, on-site professional development support for all caregivers and teachers. Figure 11: Preschool attendance by income quintile, by region, 2005 Increasing access to quality early childhood care and education settings with skilled instruction. Access to preprimary education must be improved. As indicated previously in the Global Report Card section of this report, the gross enrollment rate in low-income countries barely budged from 11% to 15% between 1990 and 2010. There are large disparities in access by household socioeconomic status; in nearly all regions of the world children from the top income quintile are more than twice as likely as the bottom income quintile to experience preprimary education. In sub-Saharan Africa, the difference is a tenfold one in access (see Figure 11). As important as access is, the quality of learning in early care and educational environments is determined centrally by the quality of interactions and instruction. Exposure to at least a year of high- quality preprimary education, for example, has consistent and positive short-term and long-term effects on childrens development. In the short run, early cognitive skills, including reading and math skills, are positively affected by preprimary education.99 In low- and middle-income countries, on-time primary school entry is increased through quality preprimary education. 47 High-quality preschool can produce lifelong benefits for society, with positive effects observed on years of completed schooling, secondary school completion, reduced crime, reduced early pregnancy, and increased earnings. These results encompass both small-scale demonstrations and large-scale programs, and are responsible for the impressive benefit-cost ratios for preschool (6 or larger, across high-, middle-, and low-income countries).100Preprimary education benefits all children, no matter their economic background, yet as with many other ECD services, those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds benefit the most.101 Earlier than the preprimary year, exposure to child care settings outside the home can also lead to benefits for young children, as long as these settings emphasize quality. These positive impacts of quality child care are stronger for more disadvantaged children.102 However, this literature on the child impacts of quality of care that supports parental employment comes from high-income countries, with almost no studies in low- and middle-income countries. Standards in preprimary education and child care should encompass two kinds of quality features that are important for childrens learning and development.103Structural quality features associated with greater gains in childrens learning include safety and support for physical health, such as access to a clean water source; smaller group sizes and lower child / adult ratios; trained and qualified teachers; the institution of not only learning standards, but specific developmentally focused curricula to support them; and adequate variety of print material, toys and other play opportunities.104 These structural resources help set the conditions for, but do not ensure, the core of preprimary education quality, which is process quality the instructional and interactive skills of the teacher or caregiver. The ability of teachers and caregivers, in particular, to provide warm and responsive interactions with children and help children express themselves through culturally appropriate social interactions and elaborated language is central to educational quality in the preprimary setting. Standards for quality should incorporate attention to cultural and linguistic contexts. For example, developmental expectations for young children within the religious and cultural context of Muslim East Africa informed the Islamic Preschool Curriculum of the Madrasa Early Childhood Development Program. That program showed positive effects on the African Child Intelligence Scale and the British Ability Scale in a controlled evaluation across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.105 Support of both home language and second language in preprimary education can build both sets of language skills and attendant developmental benefits.106 This is important given the disparities in many countries in outcomes between language-minority and language-majority populations, and the exclusion of language-minority populations from culturally appropriate educational supports. 48 How can both structural and process quality be improved? Improving the quality of early childhood care and education on both the structural and process dimensions shows important benefits for children, including efforts at scale to do so.107 Investments are required in physical infrastructure, teacher training, and learning materials to ensure structural quality. Strategies to improve process quality and instruction include the integration of on-site or technology-facilitated observation and mentoring / coaching, in addition to pre-service training with opportunities for practice.108 Despite this evidence, the vast majority of preprimary education is only supported by pre-service training without practice opportunities, and often of very low intensity. The end result can be low attendance and therefore low levels of exposure to the potential benefits of early childhood education. Successful early learning programs are not limited to center-based preschool; media-based interventions such as those of the Sesame Workshop or radio-based instruction and communication have shown positive effects on cognitive and also social and emotional development in a variety of low- income countries, for example.109 New developments in media technologies will provide huge opportunities to improve the early learning of children at scale, both in direct programs for children and in technology-supported professional development, especially in rural and remote areas (e.g., through increasingly sophisticated audio and video capture methods using cell phone technology).110 A key challenge in preprimary education is how to sustain the boost that high-quality preschool can provide to childrens learning and early school success. The massive increase in access to primary education of the last 20 years has unfortunately not often been accompanied by increases in educational quality or instruction.111 Improvement in instructional quality of the early primary grades must follow quality preprimary education, or the gains from ECD may be lost.112 Support in the early primary grades must facilitate basic competencies and learning across the cognitive, social, emotional and physical domains, as do the higher-quality early childhood care and education programs. 5.4 Achieving Target 3A through Social Protection, Workforce Development and Non-formal Education Associated Indicators for this theme: Beyond the two primary indicators for Target 3A, material in this section relates to indicators under Goal 1 (proportion of population below $1.25 per day of per capita income) and Goal 4 (proportion of households with incomes below 50% of country median income). Beyond adult and caregiving capacities, parent economic and educational factors have profound effects on childrens learning and development. Social protection policies address the pervasive problems of 49 low and fluctuating household incomes and their vulnerability to external forces such as natural disasters, climate change, famine and severe illness. They aim to increase economic stability among the poor, through cash transfers (whether conditioned on household behaviors or not) but also through efforts to promote human capital development as a long-term solution. Early childhood represents the developmental period in life when effects of poverty are most damaging and long-lasting.113 In addition, it is the period during which children have the greatest dependence on household economic resources and the investments  of time, shelter, food, and learning opportunities  that resources can buy. Thus poverty eradication through social protection policies is especially urgent during early childhood.114 Recommendation: Integrate workforce development and non-formal education interventions for parents in ECD programs and policies. Efforts to promote household economic stability and security include workforce development, non- formal education, cash transfer programs, and paid leave policies. Workforce development and non- formal education are overlooked approaches to enhancing childrens outcomes for parents of young children, despite strong evidence concerning the causal role that parental education levels can play in improving the cognitive and schooling outcomes of children.115 Even relatively short periods of participation in non-formal education were associated with improvements in childrens school achievement, in one causal analysis.116 In addition, improving the job skills of parents can lead to the kinds of jobs  those with adequate initial pay and opportunities for wage growth and advancement  that research shows increases childrens own cognitive skills and later school success.117 Although microfinance is an increasingly widespread approach to encouraging financial independence, job skills and entrepreneurship among the poor, the question of whether such programs have effects on childrens learning or other outcomes is still unresolved, with very few studies examining such outcomes.118 Cash transfer programs are perhaps the most evaluated social protection policies. Conditional cash transfer programs with conditions or benefits related to nutrition and child health have reduced stunting and underweight, and improved nutritional status in young children.119 Such policies focused on nutrition and health, as well as those that condition on pre-primary enrollment, have resulted in improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes for children, with effects generally small but larger for mothers with very low levels of education.120 Thus, social protection policies can play a critical role in supporting learning, health and behavior in the early years. Paid parental leave is a specific kind of cash transfer that serves as an important form of social protection in some countries to support families with infants and young children. It replaces lost wages for parents of infants, and provides flexibility for 50 the increased costs associated with care for the very young.121 Other subsidy systems such as those in health care or nutrition of course can also free up financial resources during this particular period of child development, when strains on families budgets and time are high. 5.5 Achieving Target 3A through Social Inclusion and Support for the Most Vulnerable Associated Indicators for this theme: Beyond the two primary indicators for Target 3A, material in this section relates to [indicator or disaggregation for individuals with disabilities], Goal 1 (the indicators of violent deaths per 100,000 population; refugees and internal displacement caused by conflict and violence), and the indicator under Goal 4 on violence against children, including physical punishment or abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect). Disparities in access to quality ECD services are pervasive, across rural / urban origin, language majority / minority status, and household income levels across all regions of the world, with higher rates of provision in urban areas and higher participation among more economically advantaged families.122 Girls show lower enrollment rates in many countries, with variation in region (the lowest gender disparities among low- and middle-income nations are in Latin America). Children with disabilities are excluded from many ECD programs and services, due to endemic discrimination as well as lack of preparation and training on the part of systems of provision and lack of enrollment.123 Across the world, immigrants without full citizenship and residency rights experience lower access to education, health and protection, often by law  their children suffer as a result of their own and their parents lack of rights, with lower cognitive and learning outcomes as early as in the first years of life.124 These inequities must be addressed through policies that ensure equitable access to quality ECD services. Recommendation: Eradicate exposure to neglect and violence in young childrens homes and communities. Implement child protection programs that promote responsive, nurturing and positive early interactions between caregivers and young children living in impoverished, harsh and/or violent environments. Children exposed to neglect and violence, whether at the community or family level, are at the very highest risk for immediate and long-term physical and mental health problems. Persistent exposure to physical punishment, psychological aggression in the home, neglect, community violence and other sources of toxic stress can create chronic states of anxiety and fear; overwhelm the developing bodys natural defences; and derail healthy development and the capacity to learn. Powerful longitudinal evidence shows the lifelong effects of such experiences in early childhood.125Solutions must address the family and systems roots of neglect and violence, for example by changing social norms and public laws surrounding these issues; engaging men in parenting programs, particularly at the transition to 51 fatherhood; and through more general efforts to strengthen families such as the approaches we reviewed above.126In particular, embedding family strengthening and violence prevention in systems with wide coverage, such as primary health care, parenting programs or early childhood care and education, as well as in child protection systems, holds great promise in reducing the incidence of children witnessing and experiencing violence.127 For example, efforts to integrate a socio-emotional emphasis in preschool education through focused teacher training reduced levels of aggression and antisocial behavior in preschool-aged children in urban Jamaica at high risk of violence exposure.128 Figure 12: Exposure to violent and non-violent discipline, 32 country sample data For children in emergency and post-conflict situations, who represent over half of children who are not in primary schooling and likely comparable proportions of children not in preprimary education, responsive implementation of early childhood family and learning supports is critical. Given the rapidity of growth during this developmental period, any months lost from the evidence based ECD supports reviewed here represent large costs to society and loss of developmental potential. The implementation of portable sets of learning materials (e.g., UNICEFs Early Childhood Development Kit), community participation and integration to organize space and conduct outreach, and capacity building and training are possible in these settings.129 For children in institutions, the provision of caring foster care homes and learning supports is also critical. Landmark studies from Romania and other countries show that the longer the delay of foster 52 care placement out of custodial institutional care in the first years, the greater the possibility of irrevocable damage to physical, cognitive, social and emotional development.130 5.6 How to Achieve Target 3A through Effective Implementation in Communities and Service Systems National policy planning in ECD has grown, with over 40 nations having passed national legislation and action plans, typically spanning the health, education, social protection and child protection sectors of services. When successful, these national efforts build on wide consultation, across government, civil society and local, national and international NGOs.131 They effectively coordinate the elements of ECD across sectors, and across national to subnational and local levels. Recommendation: Effective national policy making and action planning in ECD is supported through inter-sectoral coordination and wide government, civil society and community input. Recommendation: Support national ECD action planning through subnational and local participation in governance, finance and implementation of ECD programs and policies. Both policy planning and implementation in ECD benefit from coordination of the health, education, social protection and child protection sectors, yet such integration is difficult to achieve from the standpoints of governance, finance and implementation. Coordinating bodies such as multi-sectoral or cross-ministry ECD councils can aid tremendously in coordination, but only if they have the authority and trust of the various actors. Coordination must occur both horizontally (across sectors) and vertically (across national to subnational and local levels). A recent study in low-income countries showed that horizontal coordination, for example, may be particularly challenging at subnational levels (e.g., state, province, region or district, depending on the countrys socio-political structure).132 Effective implementation of national policies and action plans in ECD, in addition, rests on the twin pillars of community participation and service-system development and capacity. Without the development of local capacity and service systems, ECD programs and policies themselves are not likely to be sustainable, let alone contribute to a sustainable society.133 In expanding ECD, programs are often scaled up across cultures, communities and nations with reduced levels of resources per child and neglect of local culture, language or sources of expertise. Such scaling without local capacity building can reduce, not increase, the quality of services (as found in some national studies).134 A pure replication approach can result in neglect of local leadership development and buy-in, with consequences for implementation.135 53 What are solutions to these dilemmas of at-scale change in ECD? Community participation in ECD can encompass innovation in service development; in implementation; and in local governance and financing.136 The integration of ECD with local norms regarding vision for child development and adult participation; local preferences for modality and content of services; and local capacity for governance is often stated in national ECD policies, but not very often realized. Innovations on this front include local budget control and decision-making in social-sector spending that explicitly includes ECD; integration of broad consultation in development of national curricula and standards; and bottom-up, not just top-down, approaches, to assuring quality of implementation at local levels.137 Partnerships between civil-society organizations, research institutions and government, at levels from the local to the national, can set the stage for these forms of capacity building. Successful regional approaches to leadership capacity building include the Early Childhood Development Virtual University in sub-Saharan Africa.138 In increasing large-scale ECD system capacity  whether in health, education, social protection or child protection -- the implementation of training supports that integrate on-site with pre-service training has produced positive impacts on children, relative to pre-service only models.139 Continuous quality improvement approaches  in which learning communities including families, providers, and local and regional NGO and government staff define and then measure quality indicators  have been used successfully to improve health care systems, but until recently rarely in ECD. This approach, applied to the Chilean public preschool system, has been successful in engaging multiple stakeholders (parents, teachers, school directors, regional ministry staff) in coordinated quality measure development, tracking and systems improvement.140 These efforts to build ECD systems at scale benefit from effective mass communication of the benefits of early childhood development for families and society. Communications research in recent years resulted in the dissemination worldwide, for example, of core ideas such as the rapid development of brain architecture in early childhood, the economic benefits of public investment in early childhood, and the harmful lifelong effects of toxic stress in the first years. Effective messages may differ by country, cultural and linguistic context and must be accompanied by outreach through media, community and peer channels.141 54 Recommendation: Increase not only public but also private investment in early childhood; work toward parity in the proportion of international education aid spent on preprimary and early childhood education programs, relative to other levels of education. The available data on public or private spending in ECD is most extensive for preprimary education, and even there data are missing for many countries. Comparisons are difficult due to different financing patterns and cost structures for preprimary education across nations. The vast majority of countries with available data in 2009 spent less than 7 percent of their public education budgets on preprimary education; such a target applied to our proposed indicator for public spending could begin to achieve parity with spending on primary education. Among regions with multiple nations contributing data, only Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America / the Caribbean, and Western Europe were regions that included more than a couple nations spending over 7 percent.142 In international education aid, early childhood education is severely under-represented as well.143 Public financing of ECD can incorporate local participation. ECD is an explicit category for discretionary local budget planning and allocation in some low-income countries (at the municipality or village level).144 ECD finance can therefore play a role in national efforts in participatory governance. Effective local budget planning can be supported through capacity building and professional development. None of these approaches, however, should entail charging fees to recipients  such an action would risk excluding the most vulnerable children from ECD programs. 5.7 Measuring Early Childhood Development to Track Progress on Target 3A Material in this section provides guidance for the Target 3A indicator on the Early Childhood Development Index. Currently, measures of young childrens developmental potential, encompassing physical, cognitive, social and emotional dimensions, exist and are being implemented across regions (for example, in the UNICEF MICS or Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys). Thus Target 3A, ensuring that all children reach their developmental potential, can be monitored with existing data collection efforts. These large-scale, cross-national efforts, however, cannot replace the need for locally developed and culturally relevant measures of childrens development that are country-specific. Such measures are more likely to include culturally specific outcomes and milestones. Regardless of the type of assessment, measures should be developed with input from a variety of stakeholders  across caregivers, parents, and practitioners, as well as across ethnic and linguistic groups.145 55 Recommendation: Two kinds of measures of child development  1) assessment tools appropriate for monitoring population-level child development and tracking developmental growth over time; and 2) screening tools to identify individual need for services -- should be developed for country, regional and global use, with input from multiple stakeholder groups and attention to cultural relevance. Recommendation: Data systems in ECD should be strengthened  encompassing complete birth registration and measures of service quality that predict childrens learning and development. Measures of childrens development. Two kinds of childrens assessments, distinguished by their purposes, can inform and be integrated with ECD programs and policies.146 The first can achieve the goal of population-wide assessment of childrens progress across different areas of development, capturing a snapshot  whether national or subnational / regional  of childrens development. These measures should encompass attention to the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional domains of childrens development, in keeping with a comprehensive definition of developmental potential. UNICEFs MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys) includes an early childhood development module that asks caregivers and parents about their childrens physical, cognitive (language / pre-literacy, numeracy), and socio-emotional development (approaches to learning such as engagement and curiosity) and thus reaches over 60 countries capturing multiple domains of young childrens development. Other measures of caregiver- or parent-reported young child development exist or are under development, including the Early Development Instrument and the Index of Early Human Capability, which incorporate items representing each of these domains and are being used across high-, middle-, and low-income countries.147Important supplements to this form of measure are those assessments that can capture developmental growth in specific areas over time (e.g., growth in language or emotional skills). The second form of child assessment is the screening tool, which can serve to identify difficulties, delays and disabilities in development. Although data from screening tools can also be summarized across entire populations, these have the added function of enabling individual-level identification of need for further diagnostic tests and intervention. Among recent instruments of this type is the Guide for Monitoring Child Development (GMCD).148 The next challenge in measuring the development of young children for both of these purposes is to supplement adult-reported measures with locally developed direct child assessments, covering a range of domains of development, which are short and feasible to implement. Several regional and global efforts are proceeding currently to conceptualize, develop and implement such child assessments; advances should be incorporated in coming years to monitor progress on global ECD indicators.149 Measures of social and emotional development, self-regulation, and executive function skills, in 56 particular, are lacking, reflecting the lack of emphasis in the field on non-cognitive skills with important life-course consequences. Measures of ECD program quality and policy implementation. Measures of service quality, ranging from those for center-based early education programs to the wider variety of services settings in home- based and community-based programs, are urgently needed.150 Without better monitoring of such contexts with measures of quality that show adequate prediction to childrens learning, health and behavior, investments in ECD will fail to deliver promised results. Center-based measures of quality have been developed in specific nations as well as regionally, with some applied in multiple countries. However, most ECD systems still do not use measures of service quality that have been shown to predict childrens learning and development. Beyond the level of services, the regular collection and sharing of systematic information on governance and policy approaches in ECD is beginning. For example, the World Banks SABER project provides comparative data on the policy elements of ECD across countries. Finally, there is a great need to improve data system capacity in ECD. For example, birth registration systems are the foundation on which population-based estimates of childrens health, progress and supports for ECD can be ascertained. Yet more than 100 countries do not have fully functioning civil registration systems. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia are at particular risk, with 75% of unaccounted births and deaths in the world from these regions.151 Conclusion Despite the extraordinary promise of ECD to address both human and societal development, millions of children have no access to ECD services. For example, 85% of children in low-income countries had no access to preprimary education in 2010. Regionally, 83% lacked access in sub-Saharan Africa and 78% in the Arab states. Levels of public spending on pre-primary education, expressed as a percentage of public spending on education, were less than 5% in over 50% of countries with available data in the 2000s.152 The costs of business as usual, given the proven value of quality ECD programs and policies, are very high. Attention to a child-centered perspective in all sustainable development policies will benefit growth and development, not just for individual children and families, but for entire societies and the world. 57 6. Education for children between 5 and 18 years of age 6.1 Achieving Target 3B by ensuring universal access to free, quality basic education The accelerated effort at primary school expansion of the last two decades means that the remaining out of school children are truly at the margins of society-in remote geographic locations; in areas wracked by, or just recovering from conflict; belonging to the poorest or most discriminated against families; or are children who have special needs. The marginal cost of including these children is high, and reaching them will require both a special outreach effort, and a creative, flexible approach. Of the 60 million children out of school, over 25 million are concentrated in 10 countries. Nigeria is the only country where over 10 million children are estimated to be out of primary school. Pakistan (5 million), Ethiopia (2.3 million), India (2.2 million), Philippines (1.4 million), and Burkina Faso, Cote dIvoire, Kenya, and Niger(estimated 1 million) follow next(UNESCO Institute of Statistics 2010). Many other countries have several hundreds of thousands of children out of school but overall numbers are smaller due to differences in population size. In all of these countries, the out of school children represent a mix-not all of them are completely disengaged from the education system. Many of these children will have enrolled and even probably attended for some time; but the system is unable to keep them inside classrooms for all of their primary school years. There is a rich policy and academic literature on interventions to increase enrolment and retention. In this report, we highlight three efforts that have been shown to be catalytic in bringing about change. Some of these interventions have been implemented at scale, others are still relatively new; together they represent a big push to allow every child to access learning and education. In some cases they draw children into the system, in other cases, they are designed to follow children and bring education to them, wherever they may be. We urge all countries to consider these efforts to universalize education. Recommendation: Strong support for universal free basic education for all children as a prerequisite for universal enrolment, including financial support as needed. Globally, elimination of user fees has been overwhelmingly important in pushing forward enrolment rates, especially amongst the poor. The cases of Guatemala, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, among other countries, have shown that removing user fees can increase enrolments by up to 70 percent (Kattan and Burnett 2004). Apart from formal school fees, parents incur several other types of financial costs: fees for textbooks, uniforms, extra classes, sports facilities etc. within the school context and private tuitions after school. These costs add up fairly quickly; today such charges account for over 58 20 percent of total education spending, very often leading to impoverishment or routine indebtedness of families153. In many cases children (typically girls) tend to drop out after a few years. Removing user fees creates a separate set of challenges for any education system-governments need to quickly identify alternate sources of financing, and cope with increased demand, both of which put pressure on the supply side. Countries with a large proportion of private enrolments face more difficult challenges- parents see fees as a price signal of quality, even if they struggle to pay. In such cases, the focus will need to be on simultaneously building the quality of public education, while financially supporting the poorest families in exercising their choice for a high quality education. Not all out of school children are outside of the schooling system itself. Many enrol, but drop out. Some are unable to attend regularly, and lose their place. Others are unable to cope academically or need to work to supplement family incomes. Yet others are either not accessed by the state system, or are in settings with very poor quality instruction. There is a need for the state to systematically monitor and study reasons for drop-outs. In such cases, the state can provide financing so that private organizations can provide education with governmental aid and regulation. For such children, who are at the periphery of the education system, conditional cash transfers can help in facilitating access to the system. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have had a fairly successful record of inducing rises in primary education enrolment, especially in Latin America (Das et al 2005). Such programs do not work as well in places where the main challenge is supply side delivery of education. CCTs would most likely work in urban or peri-urban areas where schools and teachers are already present, and where children are unable to attend for financial or other family reasons. If targeted carefully at the poorest children in specific underserved communities, CCTs could be an effective intervention to encourage participation for a large sub-set of the out of school child population. Recommendation: Provision of adequate, long-term and predictable budgetary allocations for universal basic education, including through increased tax base and external assistance in those countries where education systems are under-resourced. The recommendation calling for universal free basic education depends on adequate funding for education. Two benchmarks are widely used: countries spend 6 percent of GNP and 20 percent of national budgets on public education4. In reality, there is wide variation in actual spending levels. Developing countries spent 4.7 percent of GNP on education as compared with 5.5 percent spent by developed countries in 2010154. For the same year, developing countries spent 16 percent of total expenditure on public education; the corresponding share for developed countries was lower at 12 4Both these benchmarks are based on a World Bank study that correlated a range of educational inputs including spending to educational outcomes across 49 low income countries (Bruns et al 2003). 59 percent.5 For countries that are severely underfunded, an increase in resources dedicated to quality education provision is essential to achieve Target 3B. Budgetary benchmarks also allow citizens and parents to hold their governments accountable to uphold their commitments to the right to education. Beyond these benchmarks, macroeconomic policies that enable long-term, predictable funding of the largest costs (typically teachers salaries) are essential to sustain educational expansion. In cases where tax revenues are inadequate, development assistance needs to increase to close the gap. UNESCO estimated the total external assistance needed to fund MDG 2 for primary completion at $36 billion. The Global Partnership for Education, a multilateral fund aimed at directing development assistance to support over 60 national educational plans has an estimated unmet external funding gap of US$8 billion by 2014. International and domestic finances need to be allocated quickly to those countries that are severely underfunded. As official assistance has declined, a number of new innovative financing mechanisms are also available (see Box 1). Box 1: Innovative Financing in Education Education remains underfunded in most of the developing world. As population grows faster in emerging markets and fragile states, quality of education is severely affected by the scarcity of resources and the insufficient public investment in the system. With international assistance continuing to decline and education needs growing, countries are turning to innovative financing, and raising funds from the market. The concept of innovative financing was first introduced by the UN Monterrey Consensus of 2002, and since then, both sovereign donors and private actors have championed a broad range of initiatives meant to mobilize more resources for development. To date, 18 debt-for-education swaps have been used in 14 countries, predominantly in Latin American debtor nations where creditors agreed to forego part of the interest rate and the principal conditional upon investing in education of an agreed amount by the debtor government. The World Bank International Development Assistance (IDA) has also utilized credit buy-downs and converted credits into grants retroactively should certain development goals in education and other essential services have been achieved. Debt conversions have had a random approach, based on the agreement of creditors and debtors to pursue them, but also depending on the availability of hard currency, the latter excluding most of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Least Developed Countries (LDC). Giving more consideration to this potential funding instrument for education in the future may yield more significant results. The Leading Group report of 2010 has advanced a series of other proposals for generating funds for development such as taxes on international financial transactions and on sports revenues as well as micro-donations on individual bank transactions in which credit card users allow banks to round up their transactions and transfer resulting amounts to education. 5Both benchmarks are imperfect since they do not control for variations in sizes of economies and populations; typically poorer countries may spend a larger share of GDP which translate into lower absolute per student spending. Comparable per student costs are harder to estimate, though estimates of $40-60 per student per year were estimated in 2003-04 by various authors (Bruns et al 2003, UN Millennium Project 2005). 60 Pursuing alternative paths including through special development bonds or expanding international solidarity levy mechanisms on online air tickets, hotel bookings and mobile phone calls could provide additional funds for education to overcome declining aid and insufficient domestic resources.

Recommendation: Country-specific outreach strategies to target the particularly hard-to-reach children in a mission mode and create solutions to address the specific barriers to participation in the schooling system In addition to the above measures, some communities and families will need to be approached in a targeted manner. Options include: identifying local education champions or role models within the community, who can form a bridge to the system to see how family constraints can be accommodated; ensuring implementation of guidelines for basic physical infrastructure of the school where it is lacking and becomes a barrier (girls bathrooms, safe and secure routes to and from school, residential facilities for nomadic populations etc.); ensuring that incentives for teachers, principals and school administrators are designed in ways that encourage them to overcome social prejudices and create a welcoming environment for these children; and encouraging linguistic diversity, that allows for children to learn in the language closest to their native tongue. If that is not possible, time should be specifically budgeted for learning a second language, and the curricular expectations from the child revised accordingly to ensure that she or he is not seen as a failure. There are several other country-specific interventions that can work- some have been tried in pilot projects, others have been scaled up with varying degrees of success. We encourage each country to commit to a detailed, specific and targeted strategy to reach its out of school children- and to creatively adapt its own systems for different target groups that need to be reached. 6.2 Achieving Target 3B by ensuring universal access to quality secondary education Over 70.5 million children of secondary school age are not attending school155. The big gains of enrolment at the basic education level have not translated into corresponding changes at the secondary level. Evidence suggests that the returns to schooling increase at the secondary level as compared to primary levels. At the secondary level, the return for every additional year of schooling can be 10 percent, and at the tertiary level, as high as 18 percent. This means that the difference in incomes between a primary and secondary school graduate is 77 percent, and that between a primary and college graduate can be up to 240 percent.156 In the case of girls, the positive externalities are even higher. Additional years of schooling are strongly correlated with smaller family sizes and with 5-10 percent reductions in infant mortality rates.157 Countries are beginning to expand access to secondary education and it is critical 61 that this expansion is done in a way that is consistent with high quality outcomes on learning and preparing young women and men to be productive citizens of their societies. Recommendation: Countries focus on universal completion of learning at the secondary school level Recommendation: If children cannot come to school, take schools to children: Invest in high-quality open schooling to accelerate reach The lesson of primary expansion of the past 2 decades has been that it is not enough to expand access to education-quality improvement has to take place simultaneously for access to be truly meaningful. It is critical therefore, to aim for universalizing secondary schooling by ensuring that children learn to standards of secondary schooling, whether they are physically inside school premises or not. Despite the $3.5 trillion being spent globally on education today, the 70.5 million secondary school-age children not in school and their families represent the failure of years of traditional state led education delivery158. Even though this number is in long term decline, it is still an affront to the years of effort put in by governments, civil society, and local communities around the world. Today, with over 5 decades of experience, it is critical to think differently about schooling itself. For those children who are the hardest to reach, it is time to take schooling and education to them directly. The experience of open schooling has shown that it can provide the framework for flexibility and inclusion- yet it has been neglected systematically by governments as an effective route of education provision.159 Open schooling by definition offers pedagogical flexibility (individual pacing, selection of subjects, asynchronous learning), institutional flexibility (timing of enrolment, geographic and age flexibility, provisions for special needs students) and program flexibility (continuous enrolment, flexibility in examinations etc.). All of these features make it amenable to accommodating students who have needs that the formal system is unable to meet. Open schooling has so far been seen as a poor substitute for the in-classroom experience. We have relatively little evidence on its performance; yet what we do know through existing studies indicates similar academic performances of students of open schools when compared to those from traditional schools on average. Many countries lack a formal policy on open schooling and a regulatory structure that defines the outcomes of such a model. Such a high quality flexible medium of instruction through open schooling should be developed and first applied to children who are not part of traditional systems. 6.3 Achieving Target 3B by Focusing on Broad Learning Outcomes Equity of access is necessary for universal education; but the success of an education system will eventually be measured not by how many children are in classrooms, but by the quality of education 62 they receive while in or out of those classrooms. The underlying assumption of universalizing access over the past several decades (measured either through enrolment or completion rates) was that once children were in the classroom they were learning age-appropriate subject matter. We now know that assumption to be patently untrue. A series of studies over the past several years have shown that there is at best a tenuous link between classroom presence and learning.160 This is a sobering finding. It calls into question over 6 decades of education policy worldwide that focused on expansion of access and provision of inputs. It has already provoked a shift in global emphasis to learning outcomes and how best to ensure that global and national education policy is refocused accordingly. Along with focusing on children who are struggling, such a focus can also allow specific education interventions for gifted children who need special pedagogical tools and curricula to realize their full potential. Traditionally, national governments in low and middle income countries have measured the success of their education policies through a combination of access and completion indicators, and through standardized exams at the end of each schooling system (typically grades 11-13, depending on the country) as an accepted proxy for learning. In several countries, standalone efforts at measuring learning have shown that children fall behind so much earlier, that by the time the proxies are used, the majority of the children have already dropped out. In India, Pakistan and in some of the African countries, civil society-run surveys (ASER, ASER-Pakistan, UWEZO) have found a majority of students lag several years behind in their reading and math ability- a trend that is stubbornly static, and in some cases showing a decline over the past eight years in which these assessments have been done.161 Recommendation: Ensuring all children attain basic learning goals in primary segment Every year, nearly 30 percent of children currently in primary school fail to complete the full primary cycle.162 In terms of attainment, the percentage is much higher. Many of them acquire some rudimentary skills, but are far below their age (and grade) appropriate learning levels. In fact, the current system of age-appropriate enrolment in grades has de facto been replaced by multi-level and multi-grade classrooms. It has been shown that grouping children by learning levels and teaching according to levels to bring all on par works when large numbers of children in primary grades lag behind several years in their basic learning. A focus on system-wide remediation can boost overall learning levels, and may give children an incentive to continue in school and give them additional attention, time, and resources to can allow for the opportunity to close their learning gaps. Preliminary evidence suggests an improvement in learning, but the information is not systematic to be able to conclusively document the benefits of system-wide remediation163. For higher grades, and more complex topics, there is less information. 63 Recommendation: Countries set national learning goals in line with international norms at the beginning, middle and end of their schooling cycle. The success of education policies is best measured against the outcome of learning. If children are learning well, they will be motivated to continue to study, and overall drop-out rates will fall. If they complete their full schooling cycle, they will be in a position to study further and acquire specific skills, contributing more effectively to the economy. Countries have so far shied away from focusing on learning. Clearly, it is much harder to focus on learning than focusing on inputs-which though important, are ultimately factors that determine how a student performs and should be treated as such. The development of national assessments that are in accordance with contextually relevant national standards is likely to have significant impact on quality. There is also a case to make for exploring how best to peg national goals to international norms. Increasing global connectivity will continue to make more occupations mobile, and eventually students will need to be globally competent. We are beginning to see examples of this through a widening of the PISA tests for example. The challenge of international or uniform goals-setting is that of heterogeneity and context- countries have different national educational objectives, curricula, and evaluation methods and imposing a uniform testing approach may not be possible, or useful.164 This is why this report does not recommend imposing one single standard; rather it recommends developing global benchmarks that countries can use as norms based on which they can set national goals. Recommendation: A comprehensive framework of learning underlines the learning goals- one that fulfils basic numeracy and comprehension skills, but also prepares students for life and livelihoods. What students learn will change fundamentally in the coming years. There are several global efforts to define the core set of skills that students need to master during their school years. The global Learning Metrics Task Force (LMTF) is a major global effort that has outlined a core set of skills for learning that encompasses the following seven domains as important for all children and youth, from early childhood through post-primary: physical well-being, social and emotional, culture and the arts, literacy and communication, learning approaches and cognition, numeracy and mathematics, and science and technology. These are critical life skills and will need to be detailed in context to national needs. In addition, content needs to reflect learning for wellbeing to maximize physical, emotional, and cognitive potential of children, while also preparing them for country-specific needs- in some cases, foreign languages, in other cases financial and digital literacy. Previously the Learning First Research Study identified an ambitious research agenda to inform policy issues around building a framework of learning. 64 Todays young people are also going to be the generation that faces and manages the challenges of sustainable development; classrooms need to teach children systematically how to live and work in, and make their societies sustainable for themselves and future generations. Finally, navigating the transition from adolescence to adulthood is a set of skills that few education systems teach their children; education systems have to provide a more structured pathway to work- either by preparing young people for further training, by fostering entrepreneurship skills that will allow them to earn their own livelihoods, or by preparing them immediately for work in their communities and local economies (see Section 6). Recommendation: Countries institute regular national sample assessments, conducted independently, drawing from the curriculum, but in line with global norms Countries need to systematically measure how learning outcomes change over time, based on different pedagogical and structural interventions. Very few countries do so regularly today, but without this knowledge, it will be impossible to either set meaningful goals, or to make serious efforts at achieving them. Standardized national level examinations fail in this task. In most countries they draw solely from the curriculum, and especially in large countries, are limited by the quality of evaluators and exam- setters, they rely on the ease of examining knowledge retention (and often replication of the prescribed text). Shifting the focus to a broad range of learning outcomes will be a big leap for most developing countries. Such a leap can begin by creating independent assessment bodies that are structurally autonomous from both the Ministries of Education, and the curriculum framing bodies. Such a body could draw on experts from within and outside the country to design ways of evaluating a broad set of learning domains (as being defined above by the LMTF). Learning goals should inform a framework of assessment throughout the school cycle so that childrens performance can be monitored periodically and where learning is not happening, steps can be taken immediately. The formative assessments by teachers in the classroom are critical to strengthen so that they can active contribute to improving learning, and empowering teachers to do better. At the same time, results of learning assessments are often unintelligible to lay people, especially parents. While it is important to have sophisticated detailed normative assessments, it is equally, if not more, important that parents of children learn about learning levels in a transparent manner. At the same time, it is important to note that an overemphasis on assessments can be counter-productive- they can create perverse incentives for teachers to teach to the tests and end up narrowing the scope of what children are taught; they may penalize poorly performing children, or worse, create standards that are not contextual or comparable. Further, it is 65 important to note that not everything of importance in education can be easily measured and it is important to value a broad range of outcomes even those which are less easy to measure. Recommendation: Priorities of teachers, school principals, administrators and the local community including pedagogy, budgets, performance incentives, and system guidelines, are oriented around learning goals for their children. A focus on learning makes it possible to create a path towards high quality education in a systematic manner. It allows for the structures and incentives within the education system to align to a focus on the child. The implications are significant: teacher education, quality of continuing professional development and support systems will evolve according to the learning needs of students, and performance measured against the trajectory of learning of his or her students. This is a fundamental shift from current norms. It will be difficult to implement, but absolutely necessary for the learning goals to be achieved. Where teachers are not equipped to deal with poorly performing students, the system should supplement with additional training, and/or teaching assistants. Successful models exist that provide teachers with supports for their in-classroom practice, some of which leverage internet, social media, and smartphones and other technologies. In implementation of learner-centred pedagogy students feedback should be taken into account when designing appropriate curricula and applying adequate teaching methods. Second, student feedback should be taken into account systematically when designing appropriate curricula, identifying pedagogical approaches and evaluating teachers, principals, and administrators as part of the learning assessment. This feedback is rarely taken, and if it is, rarely factored into systemic reform. Research shows that students evaluations of their teachers can be as predictive as assessment of teacher quality based on standardized tests, for example165. Third, pedagogical tools will need significant revision to cope with the changed metrics of the system. There is very poor capacity within education systems in most countries to revise or create new appropriate tools; building this capacity will be a central element of such an effort. Fourth, curricula need to be paced and designed in keeping with childrens ability to learn; recent studies point to the role of rushed and overambitious curricula in poor learning outcomes166. Fifth, budgets, and by extension inputs of schooling will need to be modified based on what works best to help children learn. Sixth, data on learning should be collected periodically-more frequently than the national assessments, and enough times that they give real information on how each child is progressing. Where learning trajectories are flat or too slow, the system should receive enough information from schools to enable remedial action. 66 Recommendation: Countries move towards flexible education systems, especially beyond years of primary schooling, where differentiated paces of learning are possible. Education systems are notoriously inflexible- and should remain inflexible in granting equal access to the learning process, and setting overall goals for learning achievement. But much greater flexibility is required in how to get there. Many lessons can be learnt from the experience of alternate schooling systems over the past 50 years. Some of these include:  Children learn at different paces, depending on their pre-primary life experiences and training, their parental guidance, socio-economic background, and physical environment. If there are predefined learning goals, children should be allowed to learn at a differentiated pace, within broad ranges.  Children learn differently based on their cognitive skills, experiences etc.167. In some cases, children do better with linear, structured learning. In other cases, asynchronous learning works best. A variety of pedagogical styles should be encouraged within the same system to allow for children to self-pace and self-learn but towards a high, common standard of learning.  Learning goals allow flexibility in timing of study: this allows the system to open up to children who may not be able to attend the formal 6-8 hours of time in school, but who can be allowed space and structure to learn more slowly as appropriate for them, without casting them out of the system altogether.  Small-groups with activity-based instruction should supplement whole-group instruction. In such activities, mixed-ability grouping is found to be more effective than grouping that segregates children of different ability levels. 6.4 Achieving Target 3B through Innovations in the Delivery of Education Large education systems struggle with ensuring minimum performance standards; this becomes more difficult when effective learning is brought in as a goal. If governments are committed to improving learning outcomes, then they may need to invest in different mechanisms of delivery. The recommendations below highlight some emerging innovations that will help with this focus on learning goals at the national, regional and individual level for all children. 67 Recommendation: The local community is a core partner in the delivery of education, both through contributions in curriculum and pedagogical design, and evaluations, as well as structuring the delivery model itself Most education systems are centrally designed, with little room for local communities to provide inputs. A focus on learning outcomes may allow for opening up the system to the local communities and parents of children to be part of the dialogue on how best to deliver education that creates the best learning environments for their children. Their inputs into pedagogical design (i.e. through examples of local occupations, community practices etc.) can contextualize learning and make it more immediately relevant for children and their families. Most countries have a rich tradition of native knowledge that is lost or excluded from the formal education system. Especially in the context of a broader set of learning skills, such as those of physical well-being, social and emotional, culture and the arts, and literacy and communication, parents and the local community can add to the content of learning, as well as assess learning outcomes. This is particularly challenging in the case of marginalized communities where parents may not be empowered to engage with teachers, school principals and the administration on an equal footing. Opening up the learning domains has ancillary benefits for adult learning as well; it can foster a culture of learning within the community and remove some of the social barriers to adult education, in turn, making them more involved parents. At the same time, parents and communities also need to be more aware of education rights and mobilize and advocate for greater accountability from the education system. It is important to spread awareness of such rights that stem in part from the global goals that countries sign on to. When the new sustainable development goals come into force, there should be a major effort to popularize and spread ownership of the goals amongst parents and local communities so that the objectives of the goals inform the responsibilities of educators and parents. Action Aid and the Right to Education Project has created a charter of 10 core rights for all schools to respect (see Box 2). Such efforts will be needed to popularize the SDGs and the responsibility of the schooling system in achieving them. Box 2: Empowering Communities through Rights The charter of 10 rights defined by ActionAid and the Right to Education project describes what an ideal school that offers quality education looks like. It aims to support citizens perspectives to prepare local, district and national reports on the state of education rights. Ultimately, the purpose is to strengthen the public school system. 68 Right to Free and Compulsory Education: There should be no charges, direct or indirect, for primary education. Education must gradually be made free at all levels. Right to Non- Discrimination: Schools must not make any distinction in provision based on sex, race, colour, language, religion, political opinion, nationality, ethnicity, ability, or any other status. Right to Adequate Infrastructure: There should be an appropriate number of classrooms, accessible to all, with adequate and separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys. Schools should be built with local materials and be resilient to natural risks and disasters. Right to Quality Trained Teachers: Schools should have a sufcient number of trained teachers of whom a good proportion are female; teachers should receive good quality p re-service and in-service training with built-in components on gender sensitivity, non-discrimination, and human rights. All teachers should be paid domestically competitive salaries. Right to Safe and Non-Violent Environment: Children should be safe on route to and in school. Clear anti-bullying policies and condential systems for reporting and addressing any form of abuse or violence should be in place. Right to Relevant Education: The curriculum should not discriminate and should be relevant to the social, cultural, environmental, economic and linguistic context of learners. Right to Know Your Rights: Schools should teach human rights education and childrens rights in particular. Learning should include age-appropriate and accurate information on sexual and reproductive rights. Right to Participate: Girls and boys have the right to participate in decision making processes in school. Appropriate mechanisms should be in place to enable the full, genuine and active participation of children. Right to Transparent and Accountable Schools: Schools need to have transparent and effective monitoring systems. Both communities and children should be able to participate in accountable governing bodies, management committees and parents groups. Right to Quality Learning: Girls and boys have a right to a quality learning environment and to effective teaching processes so that they can develop their personality, talents and physical and mental abilities to their fullest potential. 69 Source: Promoting rights in schools: Providing quality public education. (2011). Report by Right to Education Project, ActionAid International . Recommendation: The role of the teacher is re-imagined and countries invest in teachers to succeed. Teachers are at the core of all systems of education. Eighty five percent of teachers in developing countries are categorized as trained though definitions and capacities are variable across countries.168 In addition, there is an overall shortfall of teachers of 4 million, with specifically 2 million extra teachers needed in sub-Saharan Africa, where this need is the greatest. Two implications follow: first, despite the high proportion of officially trained teachers, learning outcomes are poor and have not improved. Second, the large number of new teachers needed across the developing world gives countries an opportunity to innovate around selection profiles, selection criteria, and training and support. Teacher motivation and teacher preparation for the task on hand in local circumstances are two key constraints in making the system learning outcome oriented. Not only do schools work in isolation from the surrounding community without involving parents in the process of education of their children, but with urbanization reaching beyond the metros, often teachers are not a part of the school-community either. There is a need to end the isolation of the school and there is a need to look into possibilities of creating community-based learning mentors who support the work of expert teachers so that parents become a part of the teaching-learning process. The role of teachers in the coming decades will be significantly different from what it has been so far. First, their role as the custodians of knowledge is rapidly eroding. Knowledge is much more freely available than before and students have many ways to access it. Second, their role as navigators of this knowledge as well as guides on interpreting and using it has become even more important. The majority of teachers are not trained for this role- yet it will be their greatest contribution in the future. The curriculum for teacher education will need to reflect this fundamental shift. Their training will likewise need to adapt significantly. To this end, teachers at all levels of education must be appropriately trained and qualified. Teachers should continue their professional development upon recruitment through a period of induction into the profession with the support by a mentor and should have access throughout their careers to high quality continuous professional development and learning. These opportunities should be provided by the public authorities or other employers at no cost to individual teachers. Recent efforts at pre-service training that integrates classroom practice, and in- service professional development are positive steps in this direction. 70 Teacher evaluation and incentives will also change- with a focus on learning outcomes, much more emphasis is needed on their ability to support children who are struggling; their ability to close the learning gaps within the classroom and between grades; and their ability to identify specific development needs within their student cohort. The evidence on the link between teacher performance and monetary rewards is mixed. Low teachers salaries and delayed payments adversely affect the quality and performance of teachers. But if salaries are above a threshold, they cease to be a significant factor in performance; training, support, an enabling environment, and other similar factors determine performance.169The role of teachers as role models, life guides, motivators and as an inspiration for their students remains as important as ever. But in order for them to fulfil their roles, a serious investment will be needed to equip them for new challenges. Finally, there is enormous scope to open up the role of teaching and bring in young people from colleges, local communities, and even retired persons to be part of the process of educating the next generation. The teaching community can be expanded in innovative ways, especially with the need for a set of skills that formal teacher training doesnt yet prepare it for. Recommendation: Use technology to open up the schooling system The promise of technology to transform education has not yet translated into reality. Efforts to deploy information and communications technology (ICT) in education have had mixed results.170Yet the potential of technology as not just an enabler but as a bridge to reach out to children and fundamentally alter the way education is delivered, remains unparalleled. The spread of mobile technology and broadband connectivity have together created a set of circumstances that did not exist even a few years ago, thus making it very difficult to predict the effect of these changes: first, the improved quality (for example, in processing abilities) and decreasing cost of end use devices (ranging from desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, tablets and smart phones) have made them available to vast numbers of households, making them economically competitive as an education delivery platform. Second, the spread of broadband connectivity and cloud computing allow for centralized virtual centers of learning with much greater ease than before. Third, improvements in learning software and instructional material have allowed for the possibility of multiple channels of learning.171Fourth, technology can remove geographic and time-related restrictions on learning-students can access teachers not just in their classes, but anywhere in the world, and at any time of the day, creating for the first time, the possibility of learning without walls and beyond the walls of the school as we know it, at comparable quality. Finally, the greatest gift of technology is that it is scalable and it is quick. Turning a large education system around takes years, if not decades, leaving at least a generation of learners behind. Technology offers the opportunity to bring about rapid improvements in learning outcomes for children-it is an 71 opportunity that all countries should recognize and experiment with. The use of ICT in education also demands that issue of equity of access to such technologies across the globe is resolved. Unless it is harnessed effectively and made available widely it will contribute to the growing gap between the wealthier and poorer societies throughout the world. It is important to note that bringing in the necessary hardware will not change outcomes. Technology can only work if it is seen as a tool for improved pedagogy and teaching rather than an end itself. It will require much greater research on how students (across different socio-economic groups) engage with technology the costs of deployment and the ways in which it can be most effect to improve educational quality at scale. For this reason, at this stage there is no one model of technological success, but greater innovation in this space has the potential to yield powerful results. Many of these possibilities are theoretical right now. But there are multiple experiments underway that will over time change the way education is structured. It is also premature to predict how technology will supplement, modify, or replace current models of formal schooling over the long run. In the short run however, there are two clear possibilities: first, technology can help reach children who are either outside of the schooling system or struggling within it. Second, technology can immediately begin improving the quality of learning for students in school. In both these cases, children can benefit significantly and school systems should begin to research the best ways of using technology to achieve greater access and quality in learning. Recommendation: The State leads on universalizing learning as the guarantor and primary provider of education, but should engage on other channels of delivering education While the public sector is the mainstay of education delivery for the poorest children in the world, the private sector is likely to continue to be a player in the delivery of educational content and services in most countries. There are inherent challenges of equity with private provision of education; yet its role in expanding access is a fact that has be dealt with, given the diversity of non-state actors engaged in the delivery of education. Its emergence itself as a significant player in the K12 delivery space is testament to the failure of the State in many countries to fulfil basic educational aspirations of children. Moving forward, a focus on learning can clarify the relationship between the State and other providers of education. The State has the primary responsibility for delivery of quality education to each and every child. A comprehensive public delivery model of high quality education is the ideal to strive for- the state is the only actor that can ensure equity of opportunity and access. But it is not the only way in which education can be delivered. By focusing on end-outcomes of learning, governments can open up various models of schools (publicly financed and run, publicly financed and privately run, or community- 72 run schools, others) that are oriented around a consensus on national standards to ensure quality education for all. In this case, the governments role, apart from its core responsibility of expanding access to equitable quality access, can be to maintain fidelity to those learning goals, and to ensure the financing, provision, regulation and standards of all education institutions as they work to achieve those goals. In countries where the private sector is already a significant provider of basic education, governments should ensure that it fulfils the goal of providing quality education, so that that the poorest of the poor are able to receive the best available education regardless of whether or not it from public or private schools (either through legislation, or through voucher schemes, or some combination thereof). In countries where the quality differential between public and private providers is significant, or where students supplement learning through private tuitions, the only long term solution is to reduce the quality gap as discussed above. In the short-term, a focus on bringing quality education to the most vulnerable and deprived children (who cannot afford private tuitions) is one way of reducing the inequities in the system. Innovations in technology for education are likely to emerge from within technology companies; identifying ways of working with technology providers to create appropriate learning material, teacher training material, assessments and delivery mechanisms can be used to target the poorest, and promote access and equity. Finally, designing a curriculum that prepares high school students for work will require working closely with industry and working in partnership with it to identify necessary skills for employment. Recommendation: Measure what we recognize; recognize what we cannot measure How educational systems will evolve will depend in many ways on what they measure. We know now that access and equity matter; the Education for All Goals and the Millennium Development Goals helped identify specific indicators that would track how countries performed on both variables, and country efforts closely tracked those indicators. In Chapter 4, we have identified indicators that will help track if governments are meeting their commitments to deliver quality education to their children. It is equally necessary to understand that there are important unknowns that we cannot yet measure. Despite years of research and analysis, we dont perfectly understand the alchemy that distinguishes a good learning experience from a poor one. We attribute teacher quality, early childhood preparation, parental influence, pedagogical tools, infrastructural factors and curriculum design to creating this mix in different magnitudes, but the learning production function is not fully understood yet. 73 Recent efforts in this context are beginning to yield rich data, for example through the use of direct observation tools (for example, Classroom Assessment Scoring Systems, Caregiver Interaction Scale, etc.). These tools are able to capture the social and emotional climate of classrooms and teaching, and not just cognitive instruction.172 Most countries struggle to fit children of different abilities and backgrounds into a common classroom setting. Despite years of such struggles, there is very poor understanding of how cognitive variation within a cohort can be brought to a common standard, or indeed, if that is possible for children with widely varying learning experiences. Specifically, for children that are behind 3-5 grade levels as compared to their cohort average, what are the best strategies for closing that gap? To what extent can such gaps be closed and how should such efforts be prioritized? Most education proponents, including the authors of this report believe implicitly in the ability of children to learn- at all ages, from all circumstances- but more research is needed to document and systematize the evidence around these abilities. Finally, are there ways of teaching children the full set of skills that they need different from the way schools are currently structured? We return to this theme repeatedly in this report not because the current structure of schooling is necessarily ineffective, but because it is too large to change direction quickly. While we focus on improving the current systems, to not consider other ways of delivering education would be a grave injustice to children currently in low quality schools across much of the developing world. We owe it to them to encourage countries to innovate-especially for the children who are at margins of our society, and in whose investment countries face the greatest challenges. 74 7. Preparing children and adults for work What do young boys and girls do after graduating from secondary school? In what ways do the years spent in the schooling system prepare these boys and girls to become productive, valued members of their society? What accounts for the steep drop in enrolments at the tertiary level? The majority of young people in developing countries do not have access to institutions of tertiary learning that have been shown to correlate strongly to improved skills and earning potential. Even after school, they do not have pathways to decent, sustainable work at a living wage. This section examines the role of tertiary education in those pathways, and the challenges of lifelong learning. 7.1 Achieving Target 3C through School to Work Transitions and Vocational Programs How young girls and boys make the transition from life as a full-time student to life as a full-time worker determines their career trajectory. Yet, this path (or multiple paths) is not well understood or documented, especially for the developing world. The best evidence is from developed countries where the education system is able to retain most students through secondary school, and which have structured systems to guide students through this change towards formal employment. For most young people in developing countries, there is no clear structural break between work and study. A small proportion continues to the formal tertiary sector and formal labour markets. Many work while they study through high school- almost all do so in the informal economy, and in their communities and on their farms. Where the quality of schooling does not offer new opportunities, many gravitate naturally to their part-time work which then converts to full-time work. For many in rural areas, migration to cities offers the promise of a wider variety of work, though often in poor conditions and at low wages. Most young people either work on farm land, or for small and medium enterprises, start small informal businesses of their own, or join small family owned units, or work as casual labour in larger organizations. These are, for most part, forced choices, and do not allow students to leverage their years of study or the timing of their transition to work to improve their quality of life. Several factors create this challenge: the informality of the economy means that potential employers are not organized in ways that can interact with schools directly; workers in the informal economy lack agency and control over their work conditions, even if they are reasonably educated; even in the organized sector, employers are not connected to the schooling system or focused on providing the best opportunities for young graduates; there is huge information asymmetry-students have little knowledge or guidance on work opportunities after school; there are few opportunities to develop local work in the community, and 75 most governments are unable to design transition programs that sort for the two parallel (and often overlapping) needs: to prepare students for tertiary education, or to enable them to work on their terms. There are different models of successful school to work and vocational programs in the developed world (Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Finland, among others). They are designed differently, but have some common elements that make them function well, and have important lessons for other countries. It is important to note that this transition is difficult; it depends not just on the quality of primary and secondary schooling, but on labour markets, on macroeconomic conditions, and on the institutional design of the program itself. All countries, even the best performing ones, struggle with maintaining effective transition programs as these conditions change. The successful ones are able to adapt quickly to changing economic needs and keep the interests of students at the core of their programs. Recommendation: Countries integrate vocational training into high school curriculum, including a component of full-time work Successful school-to-work programs all over the world begin at the high school level, not after it. While students are in the 14-15 years age group, they are exposed to rigorous vocational education (sometimes as a compulsory subject, sometimes as a separate track). This recognizes the reality that not all high school students will study further, and that for many professions, they do not need to. Further, all successful vocational programs have a component of full-time work for part of the program. This requires a tie-in with industry for placements, ensuring that the curriculum remains relevant, but also exposes students to rigors of full-time work, and is an essential to preparing them for work and for life. Recommendation: Academic and vocational tracks have multiple bridge points to students to cross over during high school and undergraduate programs Successful school-to-work programs recognize that choosing between vocational and academic tracks is difficult for young people and that these choices may change as economic and employment opportunities change. If these systems are designed as entirely separate, students will select the ones with lowest risk, and higher social value, even if these are not helpful in making the transition to work. All successful programs incentivize students to both tracks by offering, at various stages (after school, after undergraduate degrees etc.) the opportunity to switch tracks. Such switches are contingent on performance, but their presence in the design of academic and vocational programs is a critical element in attracting students to all tracks of study, and lowering the costs of that choice. Such programs also succeed in integrating literacy, math and science applied to specific vocational courses. 76 Recommendation: Schools and Colleges have career counselling and guidance for students and communication and education for parents Successful transition programs offer students and parents help in navigating the options for their future. In the case of developing countries, it is even more critical that students receive information and help in understanding the implications of their choices, since they often do not have access to general information about the economy, location of different types of work and training requirements in different professions. Japan offers the best example of this kind of help, where teachers are directly responsible for developing links with employers and for mentoring students through their work experiences. In developing countries, high school teachers can form similar links with local industry, the local community, and with potential employers in the informal economy. Schools can work with parents and communities to identify social needs that can be fulfilled by young people and advise them on how working to fill such needs can be done in ways that allow young people to be economically stable. Recommendation: Schools and Colleges invest in high quality and relevant training In all cases where school to work transition programs work, the content of the education is extremely high quality and relevant both for potential employers and for students. In developing countries, this challenge is even greater, since the foundational skills of students are typically weaker. The realities of local economies point to specific elements in the curriculum that may not be as relevant for the developed world (localized entrepreneurship skills for example). These skills should encompass not just technical knowledge, but skills on organizing, building and managing communities, identifying local needs and fulfilling those needs, and fostering creativity, leadership, and innovation in students to solve their own problems. Finally attempts at transition programs fail if they are not continually updated in line with the changing requirements. A regular revision of the program is an essential element of all successful transition programs. Recommendation: Formal Vocational Schemes are jointly designed with governments and with manufacturing and services industries Successful school to work and vocational programs are those where the design is done jointly by the government and industry. In cases where industry is the primary initiator, programs are less successful.173 This is because companies do not have incentives to prioritize student training and recruitment; neither do they have the ability or need to identify broader skills requirements for students (outside of their own specific needs). Governments are traditionally poor at designing such programs in isolation simply because they lack real-time market intelligence on jobs. The best performing systems across all developed countries are those where government guides students and sets the frame for 77 engagement with industry, and where industry guides the curriculum and pedagogical design. Allowing market dynamics to document policy action will continue to facilitate transition to work and reduce youth unemployment and frictional unemployment more broadly. Policy innovation in skills development that involves a wide participatory process of governments, private sector operators and stakeholders is more likely to contribute to inclusive market growth. While governments will continue to play a primary role in education policy formulation and in designing the architecture of national qualifications systems, markets can make a substantial contribution to empowerment and mobility of the labour force through informal skills development should such learning alternatives be recognized by the former. Recommendation: National frameworks to recognize informal / alternative skills development Poorly performing public vocational programs and a skills mismatch have not prevented businesses from growing and increasing their competitiveness in the marketplace. To overcome labour productivity shortfalls due to insufficient or absent relevant skills, firms have started to use informal skill development more than the formal alternative, finding that outcomes of the former are increasingly better. Peer learning and on-the-job-training will remain significant, considering that over 75% of the current labour force will continue to be in the labour market for the next 15 years, thus representing a remarkable source of knowledge and skills. National qualifications frameworks and formal training organizations have not yet found ways to recognize informal skills-and this hurts the mobility of the informally trained labour force. If private investment in informal skills development in all companies and in SMEs in particular is formally recognized, it will increase labour mobility, and allow individual career progression with informal skills treated as both work experience and learning processes. Policy makers, employers and employees organizations should work together to build bridges between informal skills development and formal training programmes while recognizing informal skills in the national qualifications frameworks. 7.2 Achieving Target 3C by matching skills with emerging sustainable development needs Tertiary education systems across the developing world have focused on the formal economy and have been poor at predicting and preparing for its economic and employment needs. Nearly 20 percent of all unemployed youth in low income countries are estimated to have a college degree.174Yet they are inadequately trained to do available jobs. After poor school education it becomes much harder to prepare young people for highly skilled work. Yet, it is important to remember that formal manufacturing and service sector jobs are not the mainstay of employment or earning capacities, especially in developing countries. There are many other ways of 78 matching skills to work that needs to be done in society. First, it is clear that increasing mechanization will change the kind of work that is available in capital-intensive manufacturing. The implications of this are not clearly recognized at this stage, but low-skill manufacturing is likely to see a fall in labour intensity. This means that a traditional area of employment in manufacturing is shrinking rapidly-this is also one that currently employs the largest proportion of the medium to low skilled labour force. This is a serious challenge to labour markets and a serious policy debate is needed to question whether such a shift towards automation is inevitable or socially desirable. Second, there are many areas in the informal and social economy where important social work requires skills to serve those needs. These include self-employment on farms, small entrepreneurships, farm- based cooperative and producer organizations, localized services for water, and energy supply, services such as care for the elderly and infirm, community health worker needs, management of local forests and water bodies etc. Many of these are not monetized or seen as viable avenues of professional work for young people. With the appropriate skills sets, and dialogue within communities there are ways of ensuring that these social needs can be met, and that young people can earn economically sustainable livelihoods through them. Recommendation: Countries match skills production with emerging economic and social needs, starting with specific sectors and design systems of continual engagement with potential employers The macroeconomic profile of a country, its key industries and the extent of labour-intensity of those industries will help determine the industry-specific skills that a country needs. Estimates indicate that by 2020, there will be a 15 percent shortfall in medium skilled workers in low income countries, translating into 45 million workers. This is likely to correspond to a surplus of 90-95 million low skilled workers globally; more than half will be in low income countries. 175 On the supply side, the developing world has seen a structural shift since 1980 when 60 percent of jobs were in the farming sector. Today that ratio is reversed, with over a billion jobs having been created in non-farm sectors. These jobs reflect structural shifts in their economies; middle-income and BRIC countries have seen dramatic shifts away from agriculture to services and manufacturing. Tertiary education systems in low income countries need to prepare for these shifts; by working both with potential employers, and with local communities to identify emerging needs; second, the instructional material needs to keep pace with the demands of industry, and societal needs, so that graduates are aware and capable to responding to their work requirements; third, countries need to value their young people and invest in creating hospitable, decent and high quality living conditions for them. 79 Recommendation: Countries promote skills that enable young women and men to earn livelihoods in the informal and care economies with decent working conditions and living wages Over 60 percent of the labour force in developing countries work in the informal sector or are self- employed176.Such graduates are either employed by unregulated small and medium enterprises, or are self-employed. The tertiary sector in most countries does not prepare students for informal or self- employed work. Skills in opening and running small businesses, basic accounting, management, IT and communication skills would allow young graduates to access capital and build their own enterprises at a much larger scale and with greater efficiency than they are in a position to do. Skills in social areas such as improved farming, negotiating with consumers, creating value by preserving local environmental assets, helping the local community manage its resources, and creating services for households with care needs can create sustainable, long term work. More effort is needed in understanding how such work can be compensated and supported by the government and private individuals. Recommendation: Countries invest in creating human resources for sustainable development: Over the next several decades the world will face significant development challenges. Already the needs are staggering: the world needs an incremental 4 million schoolteachers, of which 2.2 million are needed in sub-Saharan Africa; WHO estimates an additional 4.3 million community health workers will be needed in 57 priority countries alone to enable them to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; similar gaps exist in the case of urban planners, water and sanitation experts, climate change experts, agricultural extension workers and scientists, epidemiologists, energy scientists, transportation planners, engineers, etc.177 In a rapidly changing world, there is a huge paucity of skills on managing the transition of societies from rural to urban, poor to middle and high income, agricultural to service and manufacturing based in the context of climate change and sustainability issues. Developing countries have the numbers of young people needed to fill these roles, but they are not trained in such capacities as yet. Recommendation: Invest in training for a green economy Sustainable development will require choosing more inclusive and responsible business models to secure a better future for the global ecosystem178. Transformations in production (to reduce resource intensity, fuel source etc.) and in production (to improve health, preserve the quality of the environment) and to sustain growth will demand changes in skills that the education system will need to deliver. Countries need to begin planning to alter education and training content in keeping with the greening process of the global economy. Such complex transformations will need to go hand in hand with 80 improvements in the capacity of new markets to serve the poor. Education and training for the new green culture should also target the lower yields of the income pyramid where greening practices are simply too expensive to be considered right now.179 Recommendation: Countries invest in continuing education for adult women and men Extending adult literacy to all women and men is a first priority of all governments. Literacy is not just about the acquisition and use of reading, writing and numeracy skills- its direct consequence is the ability of adults to be active citizens, to have much greater voice and agency over their own lives, to improve their health, their livelihoods and to fight discrimination in all forms. The goals of literacy programmes should reflect this understanding. Further, literacy should be seen as a continuous process that requires sustained learning and application. All policies and programmes should be defined to encourage sustained participation and celebrate progressive achievement rather than focusing on one-off provision with a single end point. Adult learning programs, when designed with a clear link to empowerment, have been shown to be much more effective. The Reflect program for example, is one such effort and evaluations show that literacy achievement through this program has been double that of traditional programs as measured in El Salvador, Bangladesh and Uganda. Other consequences were seen in gender roles; improving health and hygiene; increasing school enrolment (especially of girls); strengthening productivity (e.g. diversifying crops, increasing cooperative practices) and increasing peoples involvement in and control over community development programmes.180 Recommendation: Countries invest in adult learning and skill building opportunities to strengthen the capacity of caregivers and communities to support healthy child development and create the next generation of learners As was outlined in chapter 5, young children need to have skilled and capable adults present in their lives on a consistent basis in order to provide appropriate enrichment opportunities and protection against severe adversity that are essential for healthy brain development. Three areas of adult capability that stand out as important, particularly in buffering children and building effective coping skills in the face of high levels of stress, are executive function and self-regulation skills, caregiver mental health, and family economic stability.181 At the moment, there is a need for increasing investment in testing interventions in these areas that explicitly address how these capacities not only help adults succeed in the workforce and as citizens, but also in fostering a healthy next generation of learners.182 81 7.3 The Role of Universities in developing countries Universities have traditionally played three roles in developing countries: first, as centers of knowledge production and dissemination across a range of subjects ranging from natural sciences, to economic, and social issues to the expansion and the creation of the arts; second, as creators of high skilled individuals contributing to national and the global economy; and third, as the sources for human resources and knowledge for nation building for example, in areas of agriculture, medicine, urban planning, etc. There are five broad structural variations in such institutions: first, research universities, typically public and a few in number, that focus on basic knowledge creation; provincial or regional colleges that typically produce the majority of undergraduates in the country; professional colleges that specialize in specific, typically high skill occupations; vocational colleges; and distance learning institutions. In most developing countries research universities, colleges, and distance learning institutions have been publicly funded and provided, while professional and vocational institutions typically have a mix of public and private participation. Universities across the developing world are facing similar circumstances. First, despite islands of excellence in some countries, on average universities are not comparable to developed country universities, based on standards parameters of the quality of the research being produced and the teaching. Of the top 200 universities, less than 2 percent are from developing countries183.In 2012, of the top 20 countries that applied for patents, only 2 were developing countries (India and China).184This picture is likely to change in the future as China in particular, and emerging economies in general, invests significantly in Research and Development (R&D). But for most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South Asia, there will be a huge difference in quality relative to global top performers. Second, there is a trend towards privatization of higher education across the developing world. Latin America and Asia demonstrate this trend where private enrolments have surged in the past decades. Part of this trend is a response to burgeoning demand. Enrolments in developing countries have increased 67 percent over the past decade, with the fastest growth in East Asia and the Pacific, followed by South and West Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.185 Part of the trend is recognition of the individual returns to certain kinds of higher education, where the value of professional degrees can be quantified based on employment opportunities available afterwards. Part of the trend is because government funding to higher education has simply not kept pace with the increase in enrolments. Increased privatization brings its own set of challenges: the need to ensure quality, to 82 manage the inequality that between elite private institutions and lower quality public institutions, and promote national research priorities. Third, cross-border flows of knowledge, students and teachers are accelerating rapidly. Online education is spreading quickly across developed and developing countries, and while there are many questions on how virtual education will work, it is clear that traditional models of instruction will change. In the three years since the advent of the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), these courses are already garnering hundreds of thousands of students- a feat which took the largest traditional distance and open education universities decades to achieve. Technological advancement offers the opportunity of reducing costs and increasing access at a scale that was not possible before. Students in developing countries are likely to benefit the most from access to high quality courses, but there are clear cost and access benefits for students in the developed countries as well. Both students and faculty are mobile- with the institutions that are capable of offering the best research facilities, peer group and teaching able to attract the students and teachers from around the world. Finally, the demographic transition is ensuring that the largest population cohorts in developing countries will be those in the 30-45 years age group. Over eighty percent of them have not had access to high quality tertiary education- and yet their ability to earn and be productive will depend on acquiring new skills and upgrading their current ones. Institutions of higher learning will need to offer ways for adults to re-engage with the learning process- either through distance education, or part-time courses, or specialized short-term programs. Technology can be a valuable enabler in this regard- but the structure of education needs to reflect and respond to this need so that women and men and access the tertiary education system throughout their lives. Japan is an example of a country with a well- functioning lifelong learning program where its goal is to create an enriching and dynamic society in the 21st century, forming a lifelong learning society in which people can freely choose learning opportunities at any time during their lives and in which proper recognition is accorded to those learning achievements.186 There are many aspects of higher education that developing countries need to deal with; a full discussion of all of them is outside of the scope of this report. In the next section, recommendations that would support an expansion of higher education to promote lifelong learning, and to meet the needs of a sustainable society are discussed. 83 Recommendation: Governments support universities to prioritize research based solutions for sustainable development as a core purpose Universities are in a unique position to support society in evidence-based, scientific solutions to the problems of sustainable development. Cutting edge research on issues of climate change, solutions for adaptation and mitigation, alternate energy sources, public health challenges emerging from rising temperatures, management of water resources and ecosystems are being led by academic institutions today. It is however, concentrated in a few universities. Solutions for the complex interrelated ecological, social and economic problems that societies will face will need to be developed locally. It is imperative that universities and research centers in developing countries claim the space of high quality, locally relevant research that will offer solutions to the cities and countries they are in. This will require prioritizing national and regional issues of ecology, demographic change, urbanization, public health, energy research and climatology within research, as well as developing mechanisms for engaging with policy makers, communities, and private companies to create application-based practical solutions. Recommendation: Countries create enabling regulatory frameworks that encourage public sector-led growth of higher education in collaboration with the private sector The public sector has a pivotal role in promoting basic research and knowledge production through high quality research universities. This role needs to be strengthened and funded adequately. However, it is clear that the public sector alone cannot meet the demands of higher education. It is important therefore to create an enabling regulatory framework that encourages the private sector to invest in higher education in the long run, not just in short-term, profitable professional courses, but in creating a large number of centers of excellence in different fields of research and expanding basic undergraduate and graduate programs to greater numbers of young people. A range of institutional designs, from private philanthropy led endowment based universities, to other non-profit and for profit institutions will be needed to meet the academic and professional needs of students. Regulatory structures will need to allow for this kind of institutional diversity, and reward quality and innovation and create avenues, through Advisory Councils of Science that can channel the research into practical applications. The public sector also has an important responsibility to ensure equitable access to higher education, and therefore, affordability across public and private institutions. 84 Recommendation: Academic institutions use technology to expand access, promote affordability, and allow for lifelong learning The expansion of higher education has simply not kept pace with demand- new institutions require large investments, and building a strong faculty takes time. Technology can be a powerful tool for expanding access more rapidly, and doing so at a significantly lower marginal cost. Internet connectivity is still poor in most low income countries- but it is expanding very quickly. Over the next decade and a half it is entirely possible that most large urban centers and a significant proportion of rural areas have access to broadband. In that case, blended programs of learning can allow for a much faster expansion of higher education. Countries have already begun to move in this direction (examples include Nigeria, China, India). Increasing access is important not just for school graduates, but also for adults looking to learn new skills and competencies. Universities have to prepare themselves to provide lifelong learning to their adult populations- technology allows this through online courses, and if needed, specialized mid-career programs. Investing in such programs will allow for a continuous improvement of workforce productivity at a relatively low cost. Recommendation: Universities across countries collaborate on research and teaching With the free flow of knowledge across borders, there is great scope for cross-border collaboration between universities. Such collaborations make sense on several counts: it will allow universities to retain and build their faculty (by providing a varied and rich peer network without physical relocation); it will allow for joint funding for common research questions; joint programs of study will give students exposure to other student groups and teachers in different cultural context; it will enable a faster spread of better research and teaching practices; and allow leapfrogging in academic practices between established and new institutions. 85 8. Conclusion: Future Research Needs The previous chapters laid out the imperatives for investing in high quality education systems across all age groups to create a sustainable society. In this chapter we identify areas of future research that will help countries identify ways in which education can contribute to sustainable development. 1.

Annex 1: SDSN Indicator Report Extract The following is an excerpt from the forthcoming report on Designing Sustainable Development Goals, Targets, and Indicators: a Report by the Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which outlines a recommended indicator framework for the post-2015 goal framework. ***** The Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched the Action Agenda for Sustainable Development on 6 June 2013.6 The report maps out operational priorities for the post-2015 development agenda. It proposes 10 goals and 30 targets that might replace the Millennium Development Goals after their expiration in late 2015. This report outlines a possible indicator framework to accompany Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets. As outlined in the report, many gaps will need to be filled by September 2015 to enable an effective SDG monitoring and management framework. This report seeks to help inform these important discussions and will be revised periodically. We welcome comments and suggestions that should be addressed to info@unsdsn.org. Since the intergovernmental processes, including the Open Working Group on the SDGs have yet to agree on a small number of goals and targets, this report is organized around the goals and targets proposed by the SDSN. The indicators contained in this report map well against the focus areas currently under discussion in the Open Working Group.7 Once a clear consensus has emerged on the structure of the post-2015 goals and targets, the indicator framework outlined in this working draft will be adjusted accordingly. The report is organized as follows: The main report outlines the rationale and criteria for indicators, including suggestions for how the data might be collected. A first table summarizes the 100 proposed indicators and the suggested Tier 2 indicators. It is followed by a second table that outlines how indicators for crosscutting thematic issues, such as gender equality or sustainable consumption and production, are arranged across the goals. Annex 1 outlines suggested principles for setting goals, targets, and indicators, which is also available as a stand-alone document. Annex 2 describes each Core Indicator in detail, defines suggested Tier 2 indicators, and shows how indicators work across goals. Finally, Annex 3 lists frequently asked questions that complement the FAQ in the Action Agenda and on our website. Before turning to the specifics of indicators for the SDGs, it is useful to make a few overarching points. First, the suggestions in this report remain in an early stage. We are looking for comments and creativity to improve and complete them. Second, because of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) process, the international public 6Subsequently, minor revisions to the targets have been published on the SDSN website. The report is available atwww.unsdsn.org/resources. 7 See http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/140428-Mapping-SDSN-indicators-to-OWG-focus-areas.pdf for a mapping of the indicators contained in this report against the focus areas of the Open Working Group, as of 18 April 2014. We will update this comparison as the discussions in the Open Working Group advance. 87 reporting on poverty-related indicators tends to be more developed than on other social and environmental indicators. In many cases, new indicators will have to be developed, together with information gathering systems, to cover new priorities. This will require major investments in national and international capacity to collect and synthesize data. Third, in view of the novelty of many of these indicators, the SDSN proposes to work with international institutions and other organizations during 2014 to discuss the development, relevance, accuracy, appropriateness, and realism of the recommended indicators. In some cases what we are suggesting will not be possible to implement in a timely and accurate manner. In other cases additional indicators may need to be considered. Decisions on what can actually be measured should be advised by the relevant expert communities, with the advice and leadership of the global institutions charged with oversight, measurement, standards, and implementation of programs. Fourth, the proposed indicator framework comprises a limited number of 100 core indicators to track the broad agenda of sustainable development and ensure coherence of efforts. Comments received during the public consultation of an earlier version of the report confirm that 100 core indicators is the upper limit of what the international system can report on under the SDGs. Of course, such a global indicator framework will and must not replace the much more detailed operational reporting in key areas (e.g. biodiversity under the Aichi targets, malaria control programs, education indicators under EFA). In many instances governments, such as local authorities, and other stakeholders require detailed geospatially disaggregated information and other real-time, which is not provided by a set of 100 global indicators. The SDSN is exploring with other partners how these important components of a data revolution could become part of a post-2015 monitoring framework. Similarly, the indicators will not replace organizational metrics, including key performance indicators for businesses. The SDSN will work with business organizations to explore how available business metrics might be adapted to support a global SDG indicator framework. Fifth and finally, initiation and implementation of any new information system will take time. Lead agencies should start preparing their information gathering systems as soon as possible, in anticipation of the goals and indicators that will be adopted in September 2015. The first SDG report and review can thereby commence in the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in the summer of 2016. By 2018 at the latest, we would hope that the international system, and notably the UN organizations and partner institutions (including the OECD, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and others), would have in place an accurate, meaningful, annual reporting system. We underscore that this will require enhanced support to statistical offices and systems in many countries so that high-quality data can be collected in a timely manner. 9.1 SDG Indicators The purpose of SDG indicators is twofold. First, an indicator should be a management tool, to help countries develop implementation and monitoring strategies for achieving the SDGs and to monitor progress. Second, an 88 indicator is a report card, to measure progress towards achieving a target and ensure the accountability of governments and other stakeholders for achieving the SDGs. Often, multiple indicators are used for each target. Where possible, objective quantitative metrics are used. These are complemented with experiential metrics from household and other forms of surveys, as well as subjective or perception-based indicators based on expert judgments or peoples perceptions. While there have been great improvements in data gathering, the MDG indicators have not fully fulfilled their dual purpose because the data come with too great a time lag to be useful in management and accountability. Often the MDG indicators arrive with a lag of three or more years, which is not useful for real-time management. Data from national statistical systems and household surveys is often incomplete and of poor quality. Much greater investment in building national statistical capacities, strengthening quality and standards will be required for the SDG indicators to fulfill both key functions. International agencies rely in part on primary data produced by the statistical system of each country. Involvement and cooperation between international agencies and National Statistical Offices (NSOs) was also missed by the MDG process, and must be strengthened for the SDGs. Similarly, the capacities of NSOs were not strengthened adequately to ensure effective real-time monitoring of the MDGs. All of this will require:   Investing in national statistical systems, household surveys, remote sensing, and Big Data; Identifying areas where statistical standards are currently lacking and asking the statistical community to develop them in the future;  Thinking in terms of the measurement instruments that each country should have in place (e.g. vital statistics, censuses, surveys, national accounts, administrative records, Big Data); and  Specifying the quality requirements (e.g. frequency of data-collection, timeliness of releases, geographical detail and common set of variables available for cross-classification purposes). Ideally, the national SDG Indicators should operate on an annual cycle, which could follow this schedule for example: (1) At the start of each new calendar year, one or more specialized agencies gather the national data to complete the national accounts on that indicator no later than [April 15] of the new year. (2) The national tables are then forwarded to the international organization (or organizations) tasked with preparing the Annual SDG Report. This agency (or agencies) would have [six] weeks to compile and prepare the draft report of the preceding years data. (3) The draft report would be presented at the UN to the Secretary General (SG) and the President of the General Assembly (PGA) in [early June], for a final review, and a cover statement. 89 (4) The report would be prepared for publication by [end-June] to be available to the ECOSOC ministerial meetings in [July-August]. (5) In [September-October], the report will be finalized with corrected and updated data, and the final report posted online. This approach is ambitious and will obviously push all countries and participating organizations hard, but the goal will be to turn the SDG indicators into useful tools for real-time national and sub-national management. This monitoring cycle will be unattainable without dedicated financing to improve the statistical infrastructure and capacity of each country. As highlighted by the UN Statistics Division, the main challenge is that the required capacity to measure the full range of sustainable development indicators currently does not exist in most countries.8 In the absence of adequate financing, we will have goals that cannot be used, and a process without adequate results. In our ICT-connected world, the aim for real-time data used for real-time management should be an essential and necessary component of the SDG era. In addition to national-level reporting of SDG indicators, data should also be collected and reported sub- nationally (e.g. for cities and states/provinces). Geospatial data needs to complement the headline indicators identified in this report. Ideally, the schedule for sub-national reporting would track the international schedule for harmonized country reporting. Since a very large number of indicators would be required to comprehensively track progress towards all targets, we propose that countries consider two sets of indicators. A first set of Core Indicators would be applicable to every country and track the most essential dimensions of the targets. A second set of Tier 2 indicators would track issues that may be applicable to some countries only, such as indicators for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), or that may give countries greater scope in applying complex concepts, such as inequality, to their specific needs. The Tier 2 indicators represent a menu of options for countries to choose from, though the list we include is far from exhaustive. Building upon the criteria proposed in the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) handbook,9 we propose that robust SDG indicators should to the greatest extent possible be: 1. Clear and straightforward: Indicators need to be simple to compile and interpret. 8 Un Statistical Division (2014) Compendium of Statistical Notes for the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals (OWG), paragraph 1.8, Available here: http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/3647Compendium%20of%20statistical%20notes.pdf 9 United Nations, (2003), Indicators for Monitoring the Millennium Development Goals: Definitions, Rationale, Concepts, and Sources, New York, NY: United Nations. 90 2. Consensus based in line with international standards: Core Indicators, in particular, should be underpinned by a broad international consensus on their measurement and be based on international standards, recommendations, and best practices to facilitate international comparison. 3. Broadly consistent with systems-based information: To ensure coherence indicators should be broadly consistent with systems of national accounts, systems of environmental-economic accounting, and other systems-based information. 4. Constructed from well-established data sources: Indicators should draw on well-established sources of public and private data and be consistent to enable measurement over time. 5. Disaggregated: Preference should be given to indicators that lend themselves to disaggregation by (i) characteristics of the individual or household (e.g. gender, age, income, disability, religion, race, or ethnicity)10; (ii) economic activity11; and (iii) spatial disaggregation (e.g. by metropolitan areas, urban and rural, or districts). As the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Agenda report recommends, targets can only be considered achieved if they are met for all relevant groups.12 6. Universal: The set of SDG indicators as a whole needs to track a universal agenda. Many (though not all) Core Indicators should therefore be applicable in developed as well as developing countries. 7. Managed by a designated organization: Each Core Indicator should be managed by one or more designated lead organization(s) that will be responsible for annual, high-quality national reporting of the indicator with due consideration to cost effectiveness, lean reporting processes, and national monitoring methods. We recognize that in many cases, countries will augment the global list of indicators with their own national indicators. We strongly encourage this kind of localization or contextualization of the indicators, especially since many SDGs are inherently local in orientation. In the first table below, we present 100 possible indicators to cover the 10 SDGs and 30 targets. We also identify the most likely lead organization or organizations for the specific indicator, as well as the current status of the indicator. In many cases, especially for poverty and economic indicators, the variables are already collected, e.g. as part of the MDG process. In some cases, however, the collection and reporting cycle is over several years (as with global poverty data). The SDSN will consult with relevant institutions during 2014 to determine the feasibility of an annual data cycle for each indicator. For most of the social, environmental, and governance indicators, however, the international system does not collect these indicators on a routine, harmonized, and international 10 We recommend that the disaggregation by age should at a minimum be by the following set of groups: 0-2 years (infants), 2-5 years (pre-school age), 5-14 years (school age), 15-49 years (childbearing age), 15-64 years (working ages) and 65 years and older (elderly persons). 11 For example, water use should be accounted for by economic activity using International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC. 12 High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. (2013). A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty And Transform Economies Through Sustainable Development. United Nations Publishing, 17. 91 basis. Therefore, national statistical offices and the international organizations would have to be equipped and supported to take on these new data challenges and responsibilities. As emphasized throughout, this will also require substantial investments in national statistical systems. The final point before turning to the tables is that the SDSN is not recommending, at this stage, detailed technical definitions of the indicators. That would be premature. We recommend a broad public discussion, and further dialogue with international agencies as well as national statistical offices that will likely be responsible for indicator collection and reporting. In such a process, we fully expect that other indicators may be considered and technical specifications be determined. 92 9.2 Preliminary and Incomplete Suggestions for SDG Indicators #13 Potential and Illustrative Indicator GOAL 1: End Extreme Poverty including Hunger Potential or agencies lead agency Target 1a.

Rather it must come to grips with  the  larger  issue  of  fairness  and  justice  in  social  arrangements,  including  economic  allocations,  paying  appropriate attention to the role of health in human life and freedom. Health equity is most certainly not  just about the distribution of health, not to mention the even narrower focus on the distribution of health  care.  - Amartya Sen (2002)    The  collective  efforts  of  the  global  community  towards  ending  extreme  poverty  and  hunger  and  to  promote gender equality were successfully directed by the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The  importance  of  health  as  a  key  feature  of  human  development  was  recognized,  with  three  MDGs  explicitly  linked  to  health  indicators  and  the  others  structured  around  major determinants of health.    While considerable health gains have been achieved through the MDGs, there needs to be a continued  commitment  for  accelerating  progress  related  to  those  goals,  many  of  which  will  not  be  achieved  by  2015. Epidemiological and demographic transitions accompanied by changing exposures to risk factors  have brought forth non-communicable diseases as major global contributors to preventable death and  disability. At the same time, health inequities have persisted within populations, despite improvement  in aggregate national health indicators. There is also a concern that segmentation into specific age or  risk  groups  such  as  childhood  and  pregnancy  misses  critical  periods  of  life  like  adolescence,  a  critical  period as it lays the foundation for adult health. Similarly, the health needs of the elderly must also be  addressed.    The fifteen-year period of MDGs will end in 2015. In 2012, the Rio +20 Summit further resolved to put an  end to extreme poverty and hunger by placing poverty reduction in the broader context of sustainable  development. The Summits final outcome was the call for new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  to be adopted by the United Nations (UN) post-2015.  These SDGs will set global priorities for action and  promote sustainable and equitable development worldwide.  While continuing the commitments to the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set in 2000, the SDGs will provide a framework for integrating  actions across multiple sectors to enable human development to proceed in a manner that optimizes  the equitable use of planetary resources whilst minimizing threats to sustainability.   The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)   The SDSN was launched in August 2012, under the auspices of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, as  part  of  his  efforts  to  promote  sustainable  development.  The  SDSN  mobilizes  global  scientific  and  technological  knowledge  to  address  the  challenges  of  sustainable  development.  The  SDSN  is  an  independent body of multidisciplinary and multi-institutional experts from different sectors relevant to  the  SDGs.  The  SDSN  was  mandated  to:  (i)  assist  the  UN  process  by  providing  well  argued,  evidence- informed and succinctly summarized policy briefs which would flow to the High Level Panel of Eminent  Persons, the UN Secretary Generals office, and to the Member States of the UN engaged in the inter- governmental process of defining the SDGs; (ii) to identify and evaluate innovative solutions that will  overcome  barriers  to  the  attainment  of  those  goals  and  accelerate  progress  towards  sustainable  development  at  the  global  level;  and  (iii)  to  enlist  and  strengthen  universities  and  institutions  in  4    different  countries/regions  that  can  become  catalysts  and  enablers  of  transformational  processes  leading to sustainable development, especially through the design, delivery and evaluation of innovative  solutions.   The SDSN has established 12 Thematic Groups (TGs) comprising leading scientists, engineers, academics  and  practitioners  from  civil  society  and  the  business  community  to  promote  solutions  to  the  key  challenges of sustainable development. A Leadership Council oversees the work of the UN SDSN. Health  has been a prominent focus area of the SDSN. The Thematic Group on Health for All has been discussing  the priorities and position of health in the post-2015 development agenda. The mandate of the TG on  Health is:   1) To prepare a more detailed document, amplifying the evidence for goals prioritized by the SDSN  and profiling the intersection of those goals with other development goals for submission to the  UN (this paper).  To continue to engage with the UN process for framing the post-2015 SDGs on health between  September 2013 and September 2015.  Identify  and  appraise  innovations  of  transformational  value  in  advancing  the  health  MDGs  and  future SDGs, with an emphasis on both health system interventions and multi-sectoral initiatives.   To  work  with  the  Leadership  Council  of  the  SDSN  in  building  and  strengthening  institutional  networks that will align with and assist in the implementation of the SDGs in the post-2015 phase  of global development.  2) 3) 4)  The  TG  on  Health  for  All  aims  to  review  the  global  evidence  related  to  health  and  its  relevance  to  sustainable development, link health to the social and environmental determinants influenced by other  sectors and identify pathways by which universal access to health can be advanced across the world.  Through this effort, the TG aims to assist in the vision for a better world in the 21st century, wherein all  people on earth can benefit from the fruits of sustainable development and lead long and productive  lives enriched by health and wellbeing at all ages.      5   Executive Summary  The  framework  for  sustainable  development  in  the  21st  century  must  maximize  healthy  wellbeing  at  all  ages  through  universal  health  coverage  and  pro-health  policies  in  all  sectors.  Adopting  a  life  course  approach that will benefit all persons, we recommend the health goal Achieve Health and Wellbeing at  All Ages.   To accomplish this objective we propose that all  countries  achieve  universal  health  coverage  at  every  stage  of  life,  with  particular  emphasis  on  primary  health  services,  including  mental  and  reproductive  health,  to  ensure  that  all  people  receive  quality  health  services  without  suffering  financial  hardship.  Countries implement policies to create enabling social and environmental conditions that promote the  health of populations and help individuals make healthy and sustainable decisions related to their daily  living.   Health is crucial for sustainable human development, both as an inalienable human right and an essential  contributor to the economic growth of society. Health is also a good summative measure of the progress  of  nations  in  achieving  sustainable  development.  It  contributes  to  national  development  through  productive employment, reduced expenditure on illness care and greater social cohesion. By promoting  good health at all ages, the benefits of development extend across generations. Investments in primary  health care can promote health across all social groups and reduce health inequities within and between  countries.  Improving  performance  of  health  systems  by  enhancing  financial  and  human  resources,  appropriate use of technology, community empowerment and good governance will advance this agenda.  The potential for providing large-scale employment as frontline health workers, particularly to women and  young persons, should be utilized to strengthen the economy and improve health services.    We  believe  that  universal  health  coverage  (UHC),  delivered  through  an  adequately-resourced  and  well- governed  health  system,  will  be  capable  of  addressing  these  and  other  health  challenges,  especially  if  supported by policies in other sectors which promote health and environmental sustainability and reduce  poverty. Universal health coverage must ensure equitable access to affordable, accountable, appropriate  health  services  of  assured  quality  to  all  people.  These  must  include  promotive,  preventive,  curative,  palliative  and  rehabilitative  services.  This  includes  public  health  services  such  as  infectious  disease  monitoring  and  ensuring  food  safety.  They  must  be  supported  by  policies  and  services  addressing  the  wider  social  and  environmental  determinants  of  health  for  individuals  and  populations.  Governments  must play the role of both guarantor and enabler, mobilizing all relevant societal resources for the delivery  of  health  services.  National  commitment  to  Universal  health  Coverage  must  be  legally  embedded  in  a  rights-based framework.   Since the determinants of health extend across multiple sectors, the post-2015 development agenda must  promote  synergies  and  partnerships  that  align  actions  for  better  health.  Improved  health  of  individuals  and  populations  will  also  help  in  achieving  other  development  goals  such  as  poverty  reduction,  gender  empowerment,  and  universal  education.  Several  common  determinants  also  link  health  to  the  environment, agriculture and food systems, water and energy security, urban development and transport,  trade and investment, communications, and human migration.    Apart  from  intrinsic  value  of  health,  UHC  can  create  positive  externalities  for  development,  womens  empowerment  and  gender  equity,  and  social  solidarity.  Within  the  health  sector,  primary  health  care  6    should be accorded the highest importance because of its ability to provide maximum health benefits to  all parts of society and to ensure sustainable health care expenditure levels.    We recommend the following actions be undertaken at global and national levels to achieve health and  wellbeing at all ages:    Build  on  the  successes  of  the  MDGs  and  address  gaps  in  achievement  of  MDGs  4,  5,  and  6,  while  expanding  the  agenda  to  include  action  on  other  major  causes  of  disease  burden  such  as  non- communicable diseases (NCDs) and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).   Adopt  a  life  course  approach  to  health  promotion,  disease  prevention  and  health  care,  with  particular  attention to prevention and control of communicable diseases (including but not limited to HIV/AIDS, TB,  and  malaria),  NCDs,  NTDs,  mental  illness,  injuries  and  disabilities;  promotion  of  child  and  adolescent  health;  sexual  and  reproductive  health  and  rights,  including  ensuring  safe  pregnancy;  elderly  care;  and  emergency health services.   All countries make progress to allocating at least 5% of national GDP as public financing for health (with  low- and middle-income countries reducing by at least half the gap between 5% of GDP and current public  funding);  reduce  private  out-of-pocket  spending  (OOPS)  on  health  care;  and  ensure  voluntary  health  insurance and out-of-pocket funding is less than 30% of all health expenditure.   High-income countries allocate at least 0.1% of GNI as international assistance for health, for supporting  the efforts of low- and middle-income countries for implementing UHC, as part of meeting commitments  for 0.7% of GDP in assistance and an additional $100 billion in per year in official climate finance by 2020.   All  countries  provide  high  quality  health  care  based  on  comprehensive  primary  health  services  (which  include  public  health  services  as  well  as  acute,  chronic,  and  emergency  clinical  services,  in  both  community-based  and  facility-based  settings)  to  rural  and  urban  populations,  without  financial,  geographic, gender or other social barriers to access.   Create  and  support  a  skilled,  adequately  resourced  workforce  to  deliver  the  health  services  envisaged  under  UHC,  with  emphasis  on  expanding  the  size,  skills  and  role  of  a  cadre  of  socially  empowered  community health workers who are enabled to use appropriate technologies.   Ensure access to essential medicines, vaccines, commodities, and technologies, using pooled procurement  and  distribution  of  quality-assured  drugs,  utilizing  low  cost  generics  and  price  controls  to  make  drugs  affordable to the health system as well individual patients.   Effectively implement comprehensive tobacco control programs, including all obligations contained within  the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) to substantially reduce the one billion person death  toll  from  tobacco-related  diseases  WHO  projects  for  the  21st  century,  reaching  a  tobacco-free  world  by  2030, and use analogous demand and supply reduction measures to decrease the harmful use of alcohol.   Align agriculture and food systems to assure that every person has access to a composite diet that is both  calorically adequate and nutritionally appropriate, at each stage of life.    Ensure  availability  of  clean  water  for  drinking  and  personal  hygiene,  improved  public  and  domestic  sanitation, and reduction in exposure to air (indoor & outdoor), water, light and sound pollution.  Increase  use  of  modern  fuels  and  technologies  for  domestic  purposes  and  reduction  in  exposure  to  air  pollution. Specifically there should be targets to substantially reduce exposure to ambient (outdoor) and  household air pollution.   Adopt  pro-health  policies  in  other  sectors,  such  as  trade  and  investment,  urban  design  and  transport,  while  promoting  policies  and  actions  that  mitigate  climate  change  and  develop  adaptive  strategies  to  make populations more resilient to the effects of climate change on health.   Engage and empower communities to play an active role in the design, delivery, and monitoring of health  policies and programs.   7   including  the  eradication  of  extreme  poverty,  social  Health is Central to Sustainable Development Why is health central?   By prioritizing sustainable development, societies commit to progress across four dimensions: economic  development  inclusion,  environmental  sustainability, and good governance. Each of these dimensions contributes to the others, and progress  across  all  four  is  required  for  individual  and  societal  wellbeing.  Health  is  inherently  important  as  a  human right, but is also critical to achieving these four pillars. National aspirations for economic growth  cannot be achieved without a healthy and productive population. While health benefits from economic  growth,  its  value  as  a  critical  catalyst  for  development  led  to  health-related  goals  being  centrally  positioned  in  the  MDGs.  Child  and  maternal  mortality  became  a  measure  of  a  nations  overall  development,  along  with  poverty  eradication,  the  empowerment  of  women,  and  environmental  sustainability.  At  the  same  time,  it  was  acknowledged  that  combating  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  reducing  the  burden  of  TB  and  malaria  was  critical  to  human  progress,  as  these  diseases  disproportionately impact the development potential of dozens of countries.    Further evidence of the importance of health to sustainable development are the growing number of  reports (such as the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (1999)60 emphasizing the need  for greater investments in health through increased public financing. These reports have highlighted the  multiplier effects of investment in health and the cost of neglect from preventable death and disability,  emphasizing  the  need  to  address  not  just  diseases  but  the  wider  dimensions  and  determinants  of  health.    As the world prepares to formulate and adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the health goal  proposed  by  the  SDSN  (Achieve  Health  and  Wellbeing  At  All  Ages)  must  be  recognized  as  pivotal  to  global  development.  Even  as  economic  development  is  pursued  with  vigor  by  a  world  that  wishes  to  reverse the economic downturn of the past five years, it must be clearly recognized that economic and  social progress can neither be secure nor sustainable if sufficient investments are not made to protect  and promote the health status of all people across the world.   Current status of global health and challenges   Considerable progress has been made in the achievement of MDG targets. Profound reductions have  been made in under-five deaths worldwide from more than 12 million in 1990 to around 6.6 million in  2012, and maternal deaths worldwide have dropped by 47% over this period. Around 9.7 million people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  now  have  access  to  anti-retroviral  treatments  (ART)  and  more  than  7  billion  treatments for neglected tropical diseases have been disbursed since 2005. The spread of tuberculosis is  on target to be reversed by 2015, and the global incidence of malaria has fallen by 17% since 2000. The  global target of halving the proportion of people without access to safe, clean water has been met.    Despite  these  achievements,  much  remains  to  be  done.  National  and  regional  disparities  remain  the  most formidable challenge. Several countries did not meet the targets, while others have reached their  targets  but  require  further  reductions.  Many  countries  making  progress  have  done  so  only  in  certain  populations,  inequalities  across  socioeconomic  gradients,  ethnicity,  gender,  and  geographically  marginalized  subgroups.  In  addition  to  the  mandate  set  by  the  MDGs,  epidemiological  increasing  8    and demographic transitions have driven an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs),  particularly  in  low  and  middle  income  countries,  with  increasing  exposure  to  risk  factors  like  tobacco  and alcohol use and physical inactivity; and rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer,  respiratory diseases, and mental health conditions. This implies a need for reassessing health priorities  in  all  countries,  low-,  middle-,  and  high-income,  for  the  post-2015  development  mandate,  both  to  accelerate MDG achievement and to include emerging health concerns.

Figure 1 shows the global burden of disease in 2010; the area of the box represents the percent of the  global disease burden. It is clear that many of the MDG priorities (for example HIV, TB, and malaria) will  remain  major  concerns  in  the  post-2015  period.  However,  the  post-2015  period  must  also  address  additional  health  concerns,  such  as  stroke,  heart  disease  (represented  as  IHD),  and  diabetes,  which  represent a large share of the global burden of disease. In order to accomplish the goal of Achieving  Health and Wellbeing At All Ages, a framework that addresses a greater diversity of issues than those  prioritized by the MDGs is needed.     9   The major barriers to achieving health for all relate to health systems challenges and the socioeconomic  inequities  and  environmental  exposures  that  predispose,  precipitate  and  perpetuate  vulnerability  of  individuals  and  populations  to  health  risks.  The  Thematic  Group  on  Health  for  All  strongly  advocates  global, national and regional actions for addressing these barriers.    Proposal for a Health SDG   The  MDGs  were  successful  as  a  rallying  point,  clearly  focusing  on  national  policy  efforts  towards  development.  As  simple,  quantitative  and  measurable  targets,  they  became  important  tools  for  assessing  the  progress  made  by  nations  in  improving  health  policy.  However,  in  their  approach  and  implementation,  the  exclusive  focus  on  disease-specific  goals  and  the  failure  to  integrate  issues  of  inequity  led  to  inter-  and  intra-national  differences  in  progress  towards  achieving  the  goals.  In  the  absence of a vision for strengthening systems (horizontal programs), the MDGs encouraged disease- specific  programs  (vertical  programs),  exacerbating  the  differences  between  nations in  health  status  and disease burden. At the same time, the emergence of new health challenges demonstrates the need  for reassessing the scope and relevance of the MDGs over time and to HICs.    The  new  SDGs  must  follow  an  inclusive  framework,  encapsulating  equity  and  a  systems-approach  in  achieving new health targets for 2030. The SDGs must be set using a broad framework that is universal  (i.e.  relevant  to  both  LMICs  and  HICs),  context-specific  and  adaptive.  A  number  of  consultations  and  high-level panel meetings have deliberated on potential candidates for a health SDG (Appendix 3).    After reviewing consultations and reports, the SDG proposed by the TG is Achieve Health and Wellbeing  At All Ages. This implies that all countries achieve universal health coverage at every stage of life, with  particular emphasis on primary health services, including mental and reproductive health, to ensure  that  all  people  receive  quality  health  services  without  suffering  financial  hardship.  Countries  also  implement policies to create enabling social and environmental conditions that promote the health of  populations and help individuals make healthy and sustainable decisions related to their daily living.   In its deliberations, the TG identified 3 interrelated targets and several indicators. While this list is not  exhaustive,  these  targets  and  indicators  provide  a  useful  starting  point  for  measuring  the  progress  towards  achieving  this  SDG.   The  three  targets  are  listed  below,  while  their  associated  indicators  are  available in Appendix 1.   v Ensure  universal  coverage  of  quality  healthcare,  including  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  communicable 1 and  non-communicable  diseases,  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  family  planning,  routine  immunization,  and  mental  health,  according  the  highest  priority  to  primary  health care.  v End  preventable  deaths  by  reducing  child  mortality  to  [20]  or  fewer  deaths  per  1000  births,  maternal mortality to [40] or fewer deaths per 100,000 live births, and mortality under 70 years  of age from non-communicable diseases by at least 30 percent compared with 2015.2  v Implement  policies  to  promote  and  monitor  healthy  diets,  physical  activity  and  subjective  wellbeing; reduce unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use by [30%] and harmful use of alcohol  by [20%].                                                               1 We recommend that countries adopt suitably updated MDG indicators for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, as well as for Neglected  Tropical Diseases (NTDs).   2  Countries that have achieved the mortality targets should set more ambitious aggregate targets that are commensurate with  their development and ensure that the minimum quantitative targets are achieved for every sub-population.  10    Universal Health Coverage As a Priority for Post-2015   As  debates  concerning  the  post-2015  development  agenda  intensify,  more  and  more  governments,  development  agencies  and  civil  society  organizations  are  calling  for  prioritization  of  Universal  Health  Coverage (UHC) as either a health goal or the means to achieving health goals6,16,49,51,55,63. This can be  attributed to a growing recognition that increasing health coverage delivers substantial developmental  benefits  -  both  in  terms  of  better  health  indicators  and  improved  economic  performance,  including  reduction  of  poverty  levels.36  Furthermore,  political  leaders  are  realizing  that  moving  towards  UHC  is  popular with populations across the world. By improving the health and economic welfare of all people,  governments  can  foster  social  harmony,  enhance  the  legitimacy  of  the  state  and  secure  considerable  political benefits. This is discussed briefly in in the next section.  Healthy Life Expectancy  There is growing support for healthy life expectancy as a superior metric than simple life expectancy  for tracking health outcomes and overall function of the health system. Life expectancy does not take  into account periods of ill health that do not result in death; however, many people can lose months  or  years  to  malaria,  TB,  cancer,  and  other  conditions.  Improvements  in  overall  life  expectancy  are  meaningless unless the additional years are healthy ones.    Healthy  life  expectancy  seeks  to  address  this  by  qualifying  overall  life  expectancy  with  disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) and data on morbidity to determine how many years people live at their  full potential for good health.  As a metric, healthy life expectancy is sensitive to multiple factors, not  just  mortality.  It  takes  into  account  changes  in  the  prevalence  of  diseases  over  time,  quality  of  treatment, cure rates, and other factors. This makes it a more robust measure of the overall health of  a population.    One challenge with healthy life expectancy is that there is a great range between countries in terms  of data availability. However, this metric crucial in assessing the state of global health, and therefore  for the period 2015-2030 the increased collection of quality data is crucial.     In the past three years, several consultations (Appendix 3) have deliberated on the opportunities and  challenges  provided  by  the  existing  MDGs  and  the  call  for  a  new  health  goal  which  resonates  with  contemporary  issues  and  concerns.  These  issues  have  ranged  from  universalism  versus  targeting,  inclusion,  equity,  concerns  regarding  financial  protection,  and  differences  in  interpretation,  among  others.  This  paper  argues  for  a  broad  interpretation  of  UHC  that  includes  promotive,  preventive,  curative,  palliative  and  rehabilitative  services,  as  well  as  addressing  public  health  services  such  as  infectious  disease  monitoring  and  ensuring  food  safety.  We  also  advocate  addressing  the  social,  economic,  and  environmental  determinants  of  health.  Discussion  on  the  core  components  of  UHC  is  provided in Chapter 2, but below is a discussion of the several opportunities and challenges presented  by the framework of UHC, when compared other pre-existing or potential frameworks.       11   Table 1: UHC provides several opportunities and Challenges   Challenges:  Diverse  definitions  and  models:  Diverse  definitions  and  conceptual  models  offer  implementation  of  varying  designs  delivery,  thereby  in  agreeing  on  a  common  goal  or  target  for  comparative assessment of progress.   Measured  by  diverse  metrics:  Adoption  of  specific  metrics  for  measuring  national  and  global progress towards UHC is a challenge.   for  introducing  difficulties  Potential for narrow interpretation:  UHC may  be  understood  narrowly  as  just  the  provision  of  health  care  and  many  exclude  action  on  additional determinants of health that have a  profound  influence  on  populations  and  individuals.   Such  a  restricted  interpretation  would overemphasize the biomedical model of  clinical  care  without  substantial  impact  on  population health outcomes.  Recognition  of  priority  equity  needs:  A  universal  program  may  dilute  the  priority  accorded  to  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  may  permit  in  a  disproportionate manner though better access  and negotiating power.   the  non-poor  to  benefit    Opportunities:  Inclusion:  UHC  addresses  a  wide  range  of  health  problems  across  all  age  groups  and  through the life course.    Equity:  If  designed  well  (ensuring  universal  access  to  quality  services),  UHC  has  the  potential for reducing health disparities.    Financial  protection:  UHC  reduces  out-of- pocket spending (OOPS), decreasing the risk of  poverty  spending  by  individuals.  from  health  care  Livelihood  generation:  UHC  emphasizes  a  multi-layered  health  workforce  that  delivers  primary  healthcare  services.  The  employment  of  both  physician  and  non-physician  health  care  providers  is  encouraged,  with  particular  emphasis  on  young  women  entering  labor  markets.   Common  global  vision:  UHC  is  applicable  to  both HICs and LMICs, and can be implemented  based on contextual priorities.   Unifying  global  rallying  point:  UHC  has  been  strongly  endorsed  by  the  WHO,  UN,  World  Bank,  Civil  Society  Organizations,  many  Governments  Sector  Confederations, through reports, declarations,  resolutions  and  statements  issued  in  the  past  three years.   Private  and   Underlying Principles of UHC   The  Life  Course  Approach:  The  TG  proposes  an  inclusive  health  SDG  that  does  not  look  at  disease  categories  but  instead  looks  at  maximizing  health  and  wellbeing  through  the  life  course.  This  goal  is  recommended based on criticisms of approaches that segment health and wellbeing into stages (such as  healthy infancy, healthy childhood, and healthy pregnancy). A life course approach acknowledges that  12     individuals may be affected by infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB) as well as chronic diseases (diabetes,  cancer)  and  provides  a  continuum  of  care  across  the  lifetime  of  an  individual.  It  also  recognizes  that  illness at a particular age may be preconditioned by factors operating at an earlier age (e.g., childhood  under-nutrition can predispose individuals to adult cardiovascular disease and diabetes).   Primary Health Care a Priority: The mandate for a broader UHC acknowledges the multiple dimensions  of  health  and  wellbeing.  The  focus  of  this  broader  mandate  continues  to  be  primary  health  care  achieved through horizontal programs that focus on strengthening health systems and providing public  health services such as disease surveillance. This approach recognizes the need to address challenges of  human resources, drugs and essential medicines, and nutritional policies among others.    Action on Determinants Through Multisectoral Initiatives: The TG recognizes that the agenda for the  unfinished  burden  of  disease  and  emerging  health  conditions  cannot  be  addressed  without  the  concerted engagement of a diversity of stakeholders, including government, civil society, academia, the  media, and private industry.  Further, health needs to become a priority for actors outside the health  sector,  and  sectors  must  work  together  to  accomplish  health  objectives.  An  analysis  of  some  intersectoral linkages is provided in Chapter 4.    An independent review of the first ten years of Thailands Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) shows a  dramatic reduction in the proportion of out-of-pocket spending (OOPS), decline in health  expenditure and falls in impoverishment due health care costs11. Between 1996 and 2008 the  incidence of catastrophic health care expenditure amongst the poorest quintile of UCS members fell  from 6.8% to 2.8%. Furthermore, the incidence of non-poor households falling below the poverty line  because of health care costs fell from 2.71% in 2000 to 0.49% in 2009. The review calculated that the  comprehensive benefit package provided by the UCS and the reduced level of out-of-pocket  expenditure protected a cumulative total of 292,000 households from health related  impoverishment between 2004 and 2009. This is equivalent to the area between the two lines:   Figure 2 Number of households protected from health impoverishment in Thailand (1996- 2009)   13    Equity,  Through  Models  for  Financial  Protection:  The  adopted  SDG  must  recognize  critical  concerns  regarding  equity,  in  particular  ensuring  that  poor  and  socioeconomically  disadvantaged  groups  are  protected financially from impoverishing expenditures. The TG proposes that the broader vision for UHC  must disproportionately benefit poor and deprived populations, protecting them from high healthcare  costs and from a diversity of conditions.   Making the case for UHC: Externalities and Synergies   Several arguments highlight the large positive externalities and impact of UHC on health outcomes. In  addition  to  human  rights  and  equity  as  the  basis  for  UHC  (Appendix  5),  arguments  in  its  favor  also  highlight its political and economic benefits.  Below, we summarize some of these arguments:    UHC improves health outcomes   There  is  broad  consensus  that  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  health  sector  is  to  improve  health  outcomes  (increasing healthy life expectancy, reducing maternal and child mortality rates and reducing the burden  of  disease).  It  is  vitally  important  that  health  inequalities  are  reduced  and  that  improvement  is  for  everyone, not just certain groups. Making progress towards UHC, as defined above, will reduce health  inequalities.  Causal  analyses  from  153  nations29  has  shown  that  broader  health  coverage  generally  leads to better access to necessary care and improved population health, with the largest gains accruing  to poorer people.   Impressive health outcome results have been demonstrated in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan  Africa. In a Countdown to 2015 Case Study on Niger, published in the Lancet (2012), Amouzou et al1  celebrated the impact of Nigers UHC approach in reducing child mortality from 226 deaths per 1000  live births in 2000 to 128 in 2009  an annual average reduction of 5.1%. They attributed this success  to government policies supporting universal access, provision of free health care for pregnant  women and children, and decentralized nutrition programs. This provides evidence that increasing  the coverage of effective services, combined with the removal of health service user fees that  increased financial protection and improved access, is vital for success in achieving health MDGs and  SDGs.    UHC Delivers Economic and Political Benefits  The World Health Report in 2010 demonstrated the catastrophic effects of healthcare costs, with nearly  150  million  people  worldwide  suffering  financial  hardship  and  100  million  being  pushed  below  the  poverty line as a result of OOPS. In the affluent Indian state of Gujarat, 88% of households falling below  the  poverty  line  did  so  as  a  consequence  of  health  care  costs24.  In  the  United  States,  over  50%  of  personal bankruptcies have been attributed to medical expenses53. As the WHO points out, the out-of- pocket costs incurred by poor households as a result of lack of sexual and reproductive health care are  staggering. For example, the complications from unsafe abortion cost individuals and households in sub- Saharan Africa $200 million out-of-pocket each year (WHO 2012).   Avoiding financial losses associated with unaffordable, and sometimes sudden, health care expenditure  can  help  households  stabilize  their  disposable  income  and  spend  more  on  other  goods  and  services,  improving the welfare and future prospects of the family. At a macroeconomic level, greater ability to  consume and invest stimulates growth. Worries about health care bills are the main cause of excessively  high  savings  rates  in  some  countries,  such  as  China31,  with  negative  impacts  on  economic  growth.  Recent experience in Mexico highlights the tangible benefits of UHC reforms for households.   14     If  financed  and  implemented  well,  UHC  reforms  can  be  popular  with  the  public,  reaping  political  benefits. Political leaders associated with such reforms have seen their personal popularity increase as a  result. Many major UHC processes have been initiated by political leaders in the run up to elections and  immediately  following  a  transition  of  power.  Political  leaders  in  the  process  have  derived  substantial  benefits  from  successful  reforms,  helping  them  retain  power  in  subsequent  elections  such  as  in  the  United States8. Several political pioneers of UHC have become national heroes. In 2004, the Canadian  public voted in a national poll for the Greatest Canadian4 and chose the architect of their UHC reforms,  Tommy Douglas.    For all these reasons, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Margaret Chan,  has called UHC: the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer. 7     Mexico recorded higher levels of financial protection from health care costs following nationwide  UHC reforms. In 2002 approximately 60 million people in Mexico did not have adequate financial risk  protection and had to pay for the majority of their health services through out-of-pocket payments22.  Recognizing that this had a damaging impact on the health and economic wellbeing of households,  the Government of Mexico introduced a national protection program called the Seguro Popular. This  program was mostly financed through taxation with only richer households being asked to make  modest annual contributions. Within a decade, 53 million people enrolled in Seguro Popular, the  majority coming from the 4 poorest income deciles.    A 10-year review of these reforms shows an increase in the utilization of essential services by  households, improved health outcomes and increased financial protection. From 2000 to 2006,  effective coverage of a number of key maternal and child health interventions (e.g. antenatal care,  immunizations, and treatment of diarrhea) increased significantly with Seguro Popular members  achieving higher coverage rates than uninsured people. This increased service coverage contributed  to a sustained fall in child and maternal mortality rates and a reduction in health outcome inequality.  Looking at the economic benefits of increased financial protection, survey data showed falls in  impoverishing health expenditure with greater reductions amongst Seguro Popular members. From  2000 to 2010, the incidence of catastrophic expenditure fell from 3.1% of the population to 2.0% and  impoverishing health expenditure from 3.3% to 0.8%.    15  services they need without suffering financial hardship.  Universal Health Coverage is when all people receive the quality health  Universal Health Coverage as a Priority for the Post-2015 Agenda: Concept, Components and Collaborations Concepts: What do we mean by Universal Health Coverage?   As UHC emerges as the common rallying point for health policy and advocacy, it is important to define  its  conceptual  framework.  Several  definitions  of  universal  health  coverage  exist  with  varying  levels  of  complexity56, reflecting the contextual interpretations in high, middle and low-income nations. A simple  definition incorporating the key concepts is:       Underlying  this  definition  of  UHC  is  a  complex  framework  that  represents  the  interactions  between  health systems and populations. For this report, we have defined UHC comprehensively as referring to  equitable  access  to  affordable,  accountable,  appropriate  health  services  of  assured  quality  to  all  people, including promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services. In defining UHC,  it  is  crucial  to  recognize  that  UHC  must  be  supported  by  policies  and  services  addressing  the  wider  determinants (social, environmental, and economic) of health, delivered to individuals and populations.  The role of governments and public systems as guarantors and enablers is key, even as efforts are made  to mobilize all relevant societal resources for the delivery of services. Governments must also ensure the  engagement of all stakeholders, with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups, to safeguard access to  quality care for all persons and maintain accountability.    This definition is consistent with earlier definitions provided by the WHO in 201056 and by the SDSN in  201336.  Recognizing  that  a  narrow  definition  of  UHC  may  exclude  action  on  social  and  environmental  determinants,  the  High-Level  Expert  Group  on  Universal  Health  Coverage  in  India18  expanded  the  definition to include a package of essential health services as well as a broader set of policies relevant to  public health. The goal as proposed by us includes both components.    Any  definition  of  UHC,  while  including  key  principles,  must  also  link  to  appropriate  metrics  for  measurement  of  progress  towards  the  goal.  Metrics  may  be  selected  to  include  assured  access  (e.g.,  percent  of  children  covered  by  immunization;  percent  of  women  having  access  to  sexual  and  reproductive  health  services  and  rights;  percent  of  population  provided  with  essential  drugs  as  prescribed by a doctor) AND financial protection (e.g., proportion of OOPS to total health expenditure;  proportion of the population experiencing impoverishing health expenditures). Even as a set of essential  services is provided to all, programs targeting the poor, for assured coverage of those services or the  delivery of additional services, can still be accommodated within a UHC framework.  Further, an equity  measure can be added to each metric of UHC (e.g., gaps in access and financial protection between the  highest and lowest income quintiles, different gender groups, age groups, etc. are narrowing as the UHC  programs are progressively implemented). At each stage of the evolution of UHC in a country, the health  needs of the poor and marginalized must be prioritized.     16     Components: What does Universal Health Coverage include?   Any definition of UHC must include two core components:   A. UNIVERSALISM:  Everybody  should  have  access  to  needed  promotive,  preventive,  curative,  palliative  and  rehabilitative  health  services.  Furthermore,  these  services  must  be  of  sufficient  quality to have an appropriate impact on the health of the people who are using them. It is no  use having access to health workers if they are not trained to make a correct diagnosis or if they  prescribe inappropriate or ineffective medicines.   B. EQUITY: When accessing services, people should not face high out-of-pocket expenditures that  might lead to financial hardship or deter people from using services. It is imperative that three  dimensions  of  equity  be  incorporated:  equity  in  opportunity  (the  ability  of  individuals  and  populations to maximize their potential for better health), equity in access (in the design and  delivery of health and other allied systems such as food, built environment and urban systems),  and equity in outcomes (for the measurement of which evidence needs strengthening).    In  2010,  the  World  Health  Report  depicted  UHC  as  Figure  3  illustrating  the  policy  choices  faced  by  governments  and  exemplifying  the  two  core  principles  of  universalism  and  equity.  The  diagram  asks  three critical questions:  a) Populations: Who is covered?   b) Services: What services are covered?  c) Finances: What do people have to pay out of pocket?                        Figure 3: The Universal Health Coverage Cube3                                                               3 While the diagram does not show social, environmental, or other determinants of health, it is important that the health sector  work with other sectors (for example water, sanitation, agriculture and food systems, urban planning, etc.) to address  determinants as part of a comprehensive health system. This group interprets services as including services at the level of  both individuals (ex. vaccination or the treatment of malaria) as well as polulations (ex. infectious diesase monitoring).    17   The UHC approach is useful as it recognizes that progress needs to be made along multiple dimensions;  progress along only one dimension may not be enough to improve outcomes. For instance, promising  free  health  services  is  an  ineffective  strategy  if  there  is  inequity  in  access  or  if  services  are  of  poor  quality. Similarly, UHC is effective in adjusting the relative burden of public and private financing on the  health  system,  both  in  terms  of  service  and  population  coverage,  which  is  useful  for  financing  institutions.  Finally,  UHC  is  also  effective  in  the  push  towards  increasing  population  coverage  and  expanding the beneficiary base. Similarly, the UHC approach makes the political system realize it cannot  focus on curative services alone and must ensure effective prevention policies, such as policies to curb  tobacco use, or infrastructure to ensure safe water and sanitation.   Societal and community Interhousehold and intergroup  Race  Religion  Ethnicity  Caste/Tribe including  development  partners,   The poor  Migrants  Displaced persons (civil conflict, natural disasters, climatologic events, etc.) Collaborations: Who does UHC involve?   The responsibility for achieving UHC ultimately rests with governments, who must lead the development  and implementation of UHC. However, to ensure success, all stakeholders must be involved in setting  the  strategy,  local  and  national  governments,  civil  society  organizations,  the  private  sector,  and,  most  importantly,  the  general  population.  Further,  keeping  in  mind the country context is essential. This strategy should incorporate priority actions and investments  along  each  axis,  along  with  recognizing  the  necessary  trade-offs.  For  instance,  if  greater  financing  resources  become  available  to  nations,  particularly  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (LMICs),  more  should be invested by purchasing medical equipment or eliminating co-payments for some services.                      Figure 4: Key Stakeholder Groups at Multiple Levels   The agenda for UHC must be inclusive, and must recognize the disproportionate burden of disease and  sickness  faced  by  specific  disadvantaged  groups.  UHC  must  consider  determinants  that  predispose,  precipitate or perpetuate individuals and populations to risks and reduce their resilience. A depiction of  disadvantage within households, between households, between social groups, and at the societal level  is presented in Figure 4. This representation reaffirms that, while UHC stresses Health for All, there is a  need to strengthen equity mechanisms to make the delivery of UHC more effective.    Women/Men  LGBT  Children/Adolescents  Older populations  Disability Interpersonal and Intrahousehold 18    Delivering Universal Health Coverage  There are four core requirements for implementing UHC:   1) Financing;  2) Human resources, equipment, and infrastructure;  3) Capitalizing on synergies between sectors and involving all stakeholders; and  4) Good governance.    All of these involve complex issues of policy, governance, equity and participation. Some of these are  discussed below:   Financing   Globally,  nations  at  all  income  levels  have  recognized  that  health  financing  reforms  are  essential  to  achieve UHC. In the strategies for undertaking such reforms, the WHO has advised56 that governments  must consider three main functions of the health financing system. These are:   1. Raising sufficient financial resources to cover the costs of the health system  2. Pooling resources to protect people from the financial consequences of ill-health   3. Purchasing health services to ensure the optimum use of available resources   Raising and pooling sufficient financial resources for UHC  The level of financial resources required for UHC in any particular country is a function of the UHC Cube  (i.e.  the  population  covered  and  the  range,  quantity  and  quality  of  services  covered).  A  key  to  UHC  implementation is raising domestic funding to ensure access to quality services and financial protection  to  the  entire  population.  In  the  past,  low-income  countries  were  advised  to  provide  an  essential  package of services, frequently focusing on MDG priorities (maternal and child health; HIV/AIDS, TB and  malaria).  Today  there  is  increasing  recognition  that  all  countries  must  strive  towards  good  quality,  comprehensive  primary  healthcare  (PHC)  services  for  all.  This  comprehensive  approach  must  incorporate greater  equity,  as  evidence  shows  poor and disadvantaged groups have a  greater  service  need  and  therefore  reap  greater  benefits.  While  the  majority  of  the  current  disease  burden  can  be  addressed  in  LMICs  through  primary  care  interventions  (preventive,  curative  and  rehabilitative),  over  time resources need to be increased and services expanded beyond PHC. Increased resources are also  needed  by  governments  to  meet  emerging  challenges  such  as  ageing,  epidemiological  changes  and  greater availability of new technologies.     An  increasing  global  consensus  on  the  better  performance  of  public  (or  mandatory  pre-payment)  financing  mechanisms  has  been  emerging,  in  terms  of  both  efficiency  and  equity29,34.   This  has  been  attributed  to  the  compulsory  nature  of  general  taxation  and  other  government  revenue  sources  (e.g.  royalties  on  the  exploitation  of  natural  resources)  and  social  health  insurance  contributions.  Governments  have  been  successful  in  raising  substantial  levels  of  revenue  with  relatively  low  administration  costs.  When  these  resources  have  been  pooled,  mandatory  pre-payment  mechanisms  ensure  equity,  as  healthy  and  wealthy  populations  are  compelled  to  subsidize  the  sicker  poor.  In  contrast,  point  of  service  fees  (which  the  President  of  the  World  Bank  recently  called  unjust  and  unnecessary63) raise little revenue, are associated with high administration costs and are fundamentally  inequitable  because  of  their  reliance  on  ability  to  pay.   Private,  voluntary  health  insurance  (including  community-based insurance) schemes tend to have low coverage rates, high administration costs and   19   often  exclude  the  poor5.  Several  low-  and  middle-income  countries  have  dramatically  increased  government revenue through improved collection efficiency and promoting greater tax compliance (e.g.  South  Africa17,  Kenya21).   Similarly,  domestic  government  revenue  in  LMICs  could  be  dramatically  enhanced  through  improved  global  governance  on  tax  competition  and  tax  havens,  increasing  transparency,  especially  on  payments  related  to  natural  resource  extraction  and  ensuring  fair  trade  policies.   Of  equal  importance  to  generating  sufficient  government  revenue  for  the  health  sector  is  integrating  funding  from  different  public  sources  in  large  risk  pools  to  avoid  the  inefficiencies  and  inequities associated with fragmented pools, which often translate into tiered health systems.     In 1988 Brazil initiated an extensive program of health reforms with the intention of increasing the  coverage of effective services for poor and vulnerable people, especially those who had experienced  poor quality care and high user fees. Following significant increases in public financing, the  government was able to provide universal free health services to the entire population, focusing on  the poorest, and as a result health indicators improved markedly. The Family Health Program (later  Strategy) led to the introduction and scale up of primary care teams consisting of a doctor, nurse and  community health workers that now cover over 100 million people. From 1990 to 2008, infant  mortality in Brazil fell from 46 per 1000 live births to 18 and life expectancy for both sexes increased  by 6 years over the same period. Moreover, these UHC reforms reduced health inequalities, with the  life expectancy gap between the wealthier south and poorer north falling from 8 years to 5 years   There  is  a  growing  trend  amongst  LMICs  to  develop  homegrown  systems  appropriate  for  their  own  contexts. Of particular note have been the successes of health systems in Latin America (e.g. Brazil32,  Mexico22  and  Costa  Rica9)  and  Asia  (Thailand11,  Taiwan25  and  Sri  Lanka33)  to  use  increased  public  financing to scale up coverage. These models are subtly different but all have one common feature.  In  recognizing that it is very difficult to collect insurance contributions from those employed in the informal  sector,  they  rely  heavily  on  tax  financing  to  fill  gaps,  including  innovative  tax  structures  like  tobacco  taxes  that  encourage  behavioral  change  while  raising  funds.  Funding  the  provision  of  comprehensive  PHC services for everyone will not be feasible for the lowest income countries unless there is continued  external  funding  support,  through  a  mechanism  that  allocates  external  funding  according  to  each  countrys shortfall in domestic funding, as these countries work to raise domestic funds (which is partly  dependent  on  global  action,  e.g.  to  reduce  avoidance  of  payment  of  taxes  in  LMICs  by  multinational  corporations) and close the shortfall gap over time.    While mobilizing sufficient resources is essential for UHC, prudent and strategic purchasing of services is  critical for ensuring efficient use of resources in order to maximize benefits and promote sustainability.   In  recent  years,  performance-based  provider  payment  methods,  which  links  payment  to  individual  providers or institutions to predefined activities or service quality that have proven to be cost-effective  in producing health outcome, have gained currency as a way for incentivizing providers to provide high  quality  of  care.  There  are  a  number  of  successful examples,  for  example,  in  Rwanda,  the  Republic  of  Congo, Burundi, etc. (refs). Provider payment methods also need to be accompanied by quality review  and audit, development and implementation of treatment guidelines, clinical protocol and other quality  improvement  programs.  In  areas  where  the  population  density  can  support  more  than  one  provider,  competitive  bidding  and  contracting  can  also  be  considered  to  improve  providers  and  suppliers  responsiveness to the standards and needs of the purchasers    20    Human Resources, Equipment, and Infrastructure   The global push to UHC cannot be successful without a multi-layered, skilled, adequately compensated  health  workforce,  contributing  to  preventive,  curative  and  rehabilitative  services44.  Many  challenges  face human resources for health (HRH), including complex discourses on human rights and development  (both  of  those  consuming  services  and  those  engaged  in  service  delivery),  as  well  as  around  the  economics  of  health  and  healthcare.  Unresolved  debates  have  led  to  a)  global  shortage  of  HRH,  b)  between-country and within-country disparities in the distribution of the workforce, and c) inadequacies  in  skills  and  training  of  the  existing  workforce.  This  equation  has  been  further  complicated  by  the  growing burden of NCDs that require not just vertical program delivery, but the provision of both acute  and  chronic  care.  As  plans  for  the  post-2015  development  agenda  take  shape,  these  unresolved  questions need greater research and program implementation focus, while simultaneously dealing with  the most urgent needs of health.    The agenda of UHC emphasizes the need for equitable coverage and access to health services. A major  obstacle to equity is the shortage of workers, which is particularly acute in rural areas, areas without  access to transport or communication, low-income neighborhoods, and areas without other supportive  infrastructure  such  as  schools.  In  several  LMICs,  governments  have  been  engaged  in  discussions  on  incentives  to  lure  doctors  and  skilled  medical  staff  to  these  areas.  Inequities  in  the  distribution  of  healthcare are further exacerbated by HRH-flight, or the relocation of trained medical staff from LMICs  to  HICs.  The  shortage  of  nurses  and  support  staff  in  several  LMICs  is  particularly  serious.  This  places  increasing pressure on existing staff, with impacts on efficiency and quality of services.    To reap the benefits of UHC, well-trained and well-resourced health workers, particularly those at the  frontline, need to be at the core of the global health agenda. There are roles for highly skilled doctors,  frontline workers, and village-level health and nutrition workers. Village-level health workers in LMICs  play  a  crucial  role  in  reducing  mortality  from  communicable  diseases,  a  large  share  of  which  is  attributable to the undernourishment of the child. Simple but important skills such as training village- level health workers in weighing the child according to growth charts can play a vital role in the global  war on under-nutrition. Similarly, frontline workers can play a major role in prevention by measuring  and systematically recording risk factors for NCDs, in order to initiate risk reduction measures through  counseling  and  guideline-based  therapies.  The  role  of  simple  technology  in  ensuring  a  systematic  approach can be vital.   Burundi has recorded a spectacular decline in infant and child mortality, which each fell 43% in only  five years, from 2006 to 201119. The decline began when the government provided free universal  health care for pregnant women and children under age five. In addition to removing financial  barriers, therefore increasing demand and financial protection, the Government of Burundi also  substantially raised public financing and introduced new performance-based financing systems. This  helped channel public funds (including aid) to front line services, including NDT treatment and  control, more efficiently and enabled the government to meet the huge increase in demand for  services. The higher utilization of maternal and child health services has been one of the major  factors contributing to Burundis improved health indicators.   While the right to health of those consuming health services is important, the rights of those delivering  services  are  equally  critical.  Nations  cannot  resolve  issues  around  inequality  in  health  care  delivery  without  addressing  the  structural  issues  pertaining  to  socioeconomic  conditions.  A  disproportionate   21   amount  of  research  currently  focuses  on  the  push  factors,  i.e.  how  to  get  the  HRH  to  work  in  less- served areas. A greater emphasis is needed on both research and policy action around the pull factors,  i.e. how to attract a quality work force to work to rural or less-served areas, even if it is for stipulated  periods of time (e.g. 3, 5 or 10 years). This complex agenda, involving some of the social determinants  around  rural-to-urban  migration,  rural  prosperity  and  urban  development,  holds  the  key  to  finding  sustainable solutions to health disparities.    Equally critical to achieving health objectives is ensuring that the health workforce has the equipment,  infrastructure,  and  supplies  needed  to  provide  essential  service.  A  skilled  obstetric  surgeon  cannot  provide  a  safe  caesarean  section  without  the  proper  anesthesia,  surgical  tools,  and  hygienic  room.  A  skilled community health worker needs rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and medication.    Priorities for action in this area include solving supply-chain issues with critical drugs and ensuring their  affordability;  making  sure  service  points  have  essential  equipment,  as  well  as  electricity  to  run  that  equipment; and ensuring emergency transportation to higher-level service points when necessary (i.e. a  midwife delivering in a household calling for transport to a hospital). Additionally, it is essential that care  centers be supplied with safe water and sanitation facilities.   One Million Community Health Workers Project28  Community health workers have been recognized for their success in reducing morbidity and  averting mortality in mothers, newborns and children. While they are most effective when supported  by a clinically skilled health workforce, they have proven crucial in settings where the overall primary  health care system is weak. Community health worker programs exist in several countries (Ethiopia,  Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Tanzania), but there is a critical need to scale them up  and integrate them into national health systems. To succeed, it is essential that this work force is  trained in delivering care according to standardized protocols, and provided technology through  mobile devices for monitoring services.    The initiative estimates that training and financing health workers to serve an average of 650 rural  inhabitants will cost $6.58 per patient per year, adding to an estimated $2.5 billion. This is estimated  to fall under projected governmental health budgetary constraints and within the boundaries of  donor assistance being pledged and anticipated. The program works through emphasis on four  aspects: a) Point of care diagnosis, b) scalable supervision, c) standardized care, and d) rapid training    Synergies and Stakeholders    Health linkages with other major sectors such as agriculture, education, energy, transport, housing, and  policies that address climate change, gender, womens empowerment, and urban development, provide  an  important  framework  for  engagement.  It  is  essential  that  the  post-2015  development  agenda  and  resulting  policies  recognize  these  linkages.  When  designing  policies  to  achieve  future  development  goals, impact across multiple sectors should be taken into account to increase synergistic effects and  reduce detrimental results. In particular, health should be considered when designing policies in all of  the allied sectors, and health outcomes included in the monitoring and evaluation of such policies. Some  of these interlinkages have been developed and are discussed in the next chapter.     22    Several examples from policy show the benefits of intersectoral policies. Controlling indoor air pollution  through improved cook stoves or fuel switching can benefit human health, while reducing fuel costs and  carbon  emissions.  Policies  on  indoor  air  pollution  with  a  narrow  focus  on  health  may  increase  greenhouse gas emissions for example if they depend on electricity generated by coal combustion; the  key is in identifying possible co-benefits to be achieved in the policy design stage. When designing public  transportation  systems,  urban  air  pollution  can  be  reduced,  traffic  flow  ameliorated,  and  road  safety  improved.  Planning  walkable  and  bikeable  cities  has  the  added  benefit  of  increasing  exercise  and  reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, to reap all these benefits, urban planners must work with  health officials to design coherent plans.    It is important to identify the potential positive and negative impact of policies while designing them, to  ensure that these can be monitored. For instance, agricultural policies seeking to improve incomes by  raising  the  yields  of  cash  crops  may  reduce  food  security. A  more  thoughtful  approach  to  agriculture  policy  would  examine  yields,  linking  them  to  socioeconomic  prosperity,  improved  food  security  and  nutrition. Carefully designed policies supported by economic analyses have the potential to capitalize on  linkages  between  sectors,  maximizing  positive  results  supporting  all  four  pillars  of  sustainable  development: economic, social, environmental and governance36. It is therefore critical that health be  prioritized  when  crafting  policies  on  agriculture,  education,  womens  empowerment and  other  future  priorities.    A critical component to successfully achieving multiple policy goals is the involvement of all stakeholders  throughout  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  stages  of  a  particular  policy.  Stakeholder  participation ensures effective priority setting, as community representatives are best suited to identify  key solutions. The involvement of the expert community, in the form of both academia and the private  sector, encourages innovation in policymaking and the implementation of solutions, provided conflicts  of  identified  and  excluded.  Non-profits,  community-based  organizations,  and  aid  organizations have proven to be critical in providing both knowledge and financing in interventions.   There is a significant call for greater participation of all stakeholders in the post-2015 agenda. The report  from the Secretary-General called for participatory data collection (crowd sourcing as one example) as  well as greater involvement of stakeholders in monitoring and evaluation50. The interim report of the  Open Working Group also calls for greater participation of all parts of society in setting and achieving  the post-2015 development agenda. Further, the SDSN report highlights involvement of stakeholders to  be a key component of improving governance through increasing accountability and transparency.    UHC stands to benefit greatly from involvement of stakeholders from different health fields and other  sectors. Many successful partnerships emerged to support the achievement of the MDGs, including the  GAVI  Alliance  for  vaccines  and  the  Reproductive  Health  Supplies  Coalition.   Including  representatives  from a diversity of sectors and backgrounds is a major key to the success of these programs. Successful  implementation  of  UHC  will  require  similarly  high  levels  of  involvement  from  all  groups,  as  will  the  inclusion of health in all policies to ensure the reaping of co-benefits.    interest  are    23   Good Governance and UHC   However well designed, UHC will not achieve its objectives unless the governance of the health system  can  assure  commitment,  integrity,  transparency  and  accountability  at  all  levels.  Far  too  often,  inefficiencies in the supply chain of medicines and vaccines or corruption in the process of procurement  lead  to  program  failure.  Corruption  or  lack  of  transparency  in  the  recruitment  or  transfer  of  health  workers  affects  morale,  retention  and  performance.  Effective  monitoring  and  accountability  mechanisms  are  essential  to  ensure  quality  and  price  control  in  the  public  and  private  sectors.  This  becomes even more critical when public-private partnerships are proposed. Community participation in  learning and action has been shown to yield good results in improving maternal and newborn health in  low-resource settings.41  HealthMap: Engaging the Virtual World for the Detection and Reporting of Outbreaks3   The use of technology and online systems for mapping emerging infectious diseases is increasingly  acknowledged as a useful and participatory tool for monitoring and surveillance. While still in its  early stages, the potential for reporting infectious diseases in diverse parts of the world is significant.  As a tool, it delivers real-time information on a broad range of emerging infectious diseases for a  number of consumers, including governments, local health departments and international travelers.    HealthMap and other similar applications are user-friendly. In an increasingly connected world, these  systems use local contributions of information to simulate data that can be used for infection control  and can be an aid to local surveillance systems, the latter of which may be inadequately resourced to  deal with the challenges of emerging infections.    One challenge is the sensitivity and specificity of information when supplied by the general  population instead of medical practitioners. However, these systems provide a bottom-up approach  to information and can be a useful supplement to existing surveillance systems.      24    Linking Health to other Development Goals  Health is both a pre-condition for and an outcome of sustainable development, and relates to all four  pillars of sustainable development (economic, social, environmental, and governance). It is universally  recognized  that  several  critical  determinants  of  health  and  illness  lie  outside  the  health  sector.  Education,  finance,  agriculture,  food  processing,  trade  and  investment,  environment,  urban  design,  transport, communications, law and human rights are some of the many areas where actions can enable  or  erode  health.  Health  impacts  several  core  dimensions  of  development.  A  sick  child  cannot  go  to  school and malnourished students perform poorly in academics as well as sports. A sick employee either  stays  away  from  work  (absenteeism)  or  underperforms  after  turning  up  (presenteeism),  affecting  overall economic performance. At the level of household economics, poor health impoverishes families  through costs for care, lost wages, and even permanent loss of employment. Long periods of illness lead  to stress and domestic strife within households. For all of these reasons, every SDG should consider pro- health strategies. Achieving Health and Wellbeing at All Ages is impossible without intersectoral action  and  enabling  policies  that  link  diverse  SDSN  priorities.  Some  key  areas  of  intersection  are  described  below.    Health and its relationship with the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger: Poverty, at multiple  levels,  continues  to  be  the  most  formidable  challenge  to  improvements  in  health.  The  World  Food  Program estimates that 870 million people go to bed hungry each day, and 45% of under-5 mortality is  caused by poor nutrition. Micronutrient deficiency is further responsible for much morbidity in children  and adults. The SDGs must therefore prioritize the eradication of hunger, a key component of improving  global  health.  Repeated  infections,  such  as  diarrhea  in  childhood,  leave  behind  a  legacy  of  serious,  lifelong  health  problems  such  as  stunted  growth  and  impaired  cognitive  development,  with  further  implications on work opportunities and overall  productivity. In HICs and LMICs, the increasing cost of  healthcare and rising out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) burdens households; in many regions healthcare  costs are a major reason for households falling below the poverty line. Poor nations are unable to afford  publically financed healthcare services for their populations and often rely on donor support, especially  to  reach  vulnerable  populations.  In  the  absence  of  adequate  resources,  LMICs  have  had  to  adopt  targeted instead of universalistic approaches that often miss those in greatest need. By prioritizing UHC  in  the  post-2015  development  agenda,  and  with  adequate  resources,  we  can  transform  households  impoverished by healthcare costs into resilient households that are active in the community. Over time,  as poverty is reduced and incomes rise, countries will need to rely less and less on donor support and  will eventually be able to finance UHC.    Health and achieving development within planetary boundaries: The SDSNs report An Action Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  states  that  all  countries  have  a  right  to  development  that  respects  planetary boundaries, ensures sustainable production and consumption patterns, and helps to stabilize  the global population by mid-century. UHC plays a key role in accomplishing this goal. UHC can help to  ensure universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are upheld, empowering all women and men,  including adolescents and youth, to make educated decisions about their own sexual and reproductive  lives and healthcare, including family planning. Many policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  promote  development  within  planetary  boundaries  can  also  benefit  health  through,  for  example,  reduced exposure to air pollution, increased physical activity, and dietary change (see the section below  in climate change for more information).     25   Health and its relationship with ensuring effective learning for all children and youth: Education and  health  are  profoundly  linked;  both  are  human  rights,  and  are  inputs  into  human  capital.  Better  education contributes to better health, through increased employment  generating income, increasing  the  ability  of  households  to  afford  better  nutrition  and  healthcare.  There  is  abundant  evidence  from  across the world that education positively impacts the health status of individuals within countries, even  independent  of  income.  Education,  especially  womens  education,  is  another  key  investment  with  a  direct  impact  on  family  planning,  child  health  and  development,  and  family  nutrition.  This  is  because  education increases awareness of risk factors, health seeking and health utilization behaviors. In turn,  better  health  has  significant  impact  on  education.  As  discussed,  healthy,  well-nourished  children  do  better in school. Stunting from under-nutrition in early childhood has been shown to have an impact on  IQ  and  cognitive  development,  affecting  learning  and  long-term  career  prospects.  Vaccines  have  the  power to transform lives, giving children a chance to grow up healthy, go to school, and improve their  life prospects. The relationships between education and health are vital and cannot be ignored. In the  post-2015  agenda,  it  is  crucial  that  synergies  between  education  and  health  be  realized,  such  as  described in the SDSN report An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development.4   Universal  education  for  all  children  must  be  advanced  vigorously,  and  health  literacy  could  be  fast- tracked  through  mass  media  and  settings-based  non-formal  health  education.  A  variety  of  communication channels and social networks can be used for this purpose. Increasing the health literacy  of young persons is an especially high priority to empower the global citizens of the 21st century with the  knowledge,  motivation  and  skills  needed  to  help  them  to  protect  personal  health  and  act  as  societal  change agents for promoting population health. Youth-friendly health education is especially important  in  preventing  unwanted  pregnancy  and  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  teaching  values  of  human  rights  and  gender  equity,  and  encouraging  healthy  habits  such  as  healthy  diets,  physical  activity,  and  the  prevention of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use throughout the life course.   Health and its relationship achieving gender equality, social inclusion, and human rights for all: UHC  will  be  a  significant  step  in  realizing  the  right  to  health  for  all.  UHC  ensures equality  in  coverage  and  access to health services for all people. However, social policy at the national level cannot be successful  without  recognizing  within-household  and  within-country  inequalities  based  on  discrimination  due  to  gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, refugee status, or other status. It is  therefore  important  that  health  indicators  are  disaggregated  and  achievements  between  groups  be  compared to ensure equity in improvements.  Where there are gaps in achievement between groups,  countries must implement policies to ensure the closing of such gaps. In some instances this will require  innovative  programs  to  address  cultural  barriers  to  consuming  health  services.  Further,  by  ensuring  equity in both access to and utilization of health services by all people, inequalities in other sectors such  as employment will be reduced. In addition, the post-2015 development agenda should call on countries  to  address  assault  and  violence  against  women  and  other  marginalized  groups  (including  sexual  violence),  violent  crime,  female  genital  mutilation,  service  provision  for  displaced  and  refugee  communities,  and  other  determinants  of  health  that  are  driven  by  political  and/or  cultural  factors.  Sexual and reproductive health and rights are especially critical, as women and girls bear the brunt of  sexual and reproductive health problems. The primary health care system, as part of the delivery of SRH                                                               4 More information on the linkages between health and education can be found in the Report of the SDSN Thematic Group on  Early Childhood Development, Education and Learning, and Transition to Work entitled The Future Of Our Children: Lifelong,  Multi-Generational Learning For Sustainable Development. www.unsdsn.org/resources   26    services,  should  ensure  detection  and  comprehensive  responses  to  gender-based  violence,  offering  a  package of critical services to victims/survivors.5    Gender, Health Systems and Knowledge Translation:   Early marriage and related teenage pregnancies are a result of highly unequal gender relations and  discrimination against girls and women. WHO reports that complications from pregnancy and  childbirth are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19 years in many low- and middle- income countries. Stillbirths and newborn deaths are 50% higher among infants born to adolescent  mothers than among those born to mothers aged 20-29 years. Health policies and programs that  focus merely on institutional deliveries ignore these facts. In 2008, a project in Koppal, Karnataka  (India)14,15 combined a nuanced gendered framework to strengthen evidence and advocacy to  reduce maternal morbidity, mortality and violence against women.  The projects verbal autopsies of  maternal deaths and near misses since 2008 revealed systemic failures and the need for  accountability in obstetric care and health systems that fuelled high levels of maternal mortality  despite rising rates of institutional delivery.     Health and its relationship with improving agricultural systems and raising rural prosperity: The MDGs  put  emphasis  on  improving  food  security,  but  did  not  devote  much  attention  to  improving  rural  infrastructure  (irrigation,  safe  drinking  water,  sanitation,  fuel,  power/electricity,  banking,  transport,  health service provision, education, and information technology) as a means to improve rural livelihoods  and increase production sustainably. The post-2015 agenda needs to consider how rural prosperity can  improve the lives of millions of smallholder farmers while simultaneously improving diets and nutrition  for  both  rural  and  urban  dwellers,  in  all  countries.  This  can  also  reduce  the  health  impact  of  deforestation,  air  and  water  pollution  and  zoonotic  diseases  to  which  agriculture  contributes.  Since  women  are  employed  in  very  large  numbers  in  farming,  their  health  is  directly  linked  to  safety  of  agricultural methods and in turn on their ability to contribute to agricultural productivity.    A detailed framework for Sustainable Agroecological Intensification (SAI) and rural development can be  found in the report of the SDSNs TG on Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems37. A key component  of this framework is expanding health coverage to smallholder farmers, especially the rural poor who  currently have low access to care. Ensuring their health has implications for increasing farm productivity  and improving food and nutrition security. Hitherto, the objective of agriculture systems was to provide  energy  (caloric)  security,  without  taking  into  account  the  multiple  nutrient  needs  that  can  only  be  obtained through balanced composite diets. This resulted in a disproportionate emphasis on supply of  cereals as the source of calories. From now on, agriculture systems have to become better aligned to  nutrition goals, so that all persons, everywhere in the world, will have access to diets that are calorically  adequate and nutritionally appropriate.6   Health and its relationship with empowering inclusive, productive and resilient cities: The growth of  cities and progressive urbanization of the global population presents challenges as well as opportunities                                                               5 More information on the linkages between health and social inclusion can be found in the Report of the SDSN Thematic Group  on Challenges of Social Inclusion: Gender, Inequalities, and Human Rights entitled Achieving Gender Equality, Social Inclusion,  and Human Rights for All: Challenges and Priorities for the Sustainable Development Agenda. www.unsdsn.org/resources  6 More information on the linkages between health and agriculture can be found in the Report of the SDSN Thematic Group on  Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems entitled Solutions for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems.  www.unsdsn.org/resources    27   for health. The urban poor suffer daily deprivations of shelter and food security, with millions living in  slums and squatter settlements prone to water and sanitation-related diseases. Urban dwellers, rich and  poor, are at greater risk of harmful health behaviors like smoking, alcohol and drug use, diseases like TB  and  dengue  fever,  and  road  traffic  injuries,  relative  to  their  rural  counterparts.  Urban  populations,  particularly  those  residing  in  unplanned  housing  or  densely  populated  areas,  are  disproportionately  affected by environmental disasters.    Services  related  to  the  provision  of  clean  water  supply  (for  drinking  and  hygiene),  sanitation,  green  spaces, community recreational facilities, protected cycling lanes, safe pedestrian paths, traffic safety,  pollution  control  and  public  protection  from  crime  are  among  the  health  needs  that  the  SDSNs  Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities address in their report38. It is important that UHC also be realized  in urban settings, as a complement to better city planning policies. The health needs of rural to urban  migrants and slum communities need particular attention, particularly as spatial design is developed for  accessible  primary  health  care  through  suitably  located  community  health  centers.  The  SDGs  are  an  opportunity for health-friendly urbanization and to invest in gathering greater evidence on the costs and  benefits of urbanization on human health.7    Health  and  its  relationship  with  curbing  human-induced  climate  change  and  ensuring  sustainable  energy: Air pollution is a leading cause of premature death, with most deaths occurring in LMICs. The  2010  Global  Burden  of  Disease  study  found  that  3.2  million  deaths  each  year  can  be  attributed  to  outdoor  air  pollution,  with  most  deaths  occurring  in  cities,  and  another  3.5  million  due  to  indoor  air  pollution, mostly in rural areas. Fuel-based lighting also leads to burn injuries and dangerous fires. While  urban and rural residents face different health problems as a result of energy use, there is a common  solution:   access  to  modern,  clean  energy  services  and  increased  energy  efficiency.  There  are  many  innovative programs installing solar, wind and natural gas in both rural and urban settings, many done  under the auspices of the UN initiative Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). Modern and efficient energy  services  improve  health  outcomes,  as  delivery  rooms  are  well-lit,  vaccines  refrigerated,  and  electrical  equipment like EKG machines available. Access to modern and clean energy services, provided through  either traditional grid-connected means or innovative models of off-grid wind and solar, are important  for clinics to provide quality healthcare. In the developed world, healthcare is often energy-intensive,  but  new,  efficient  medical  appliances  offer  solutions  to  improve  load-management.  Reduced  energy  consumption is not only eco-friendly and reduces health-risks from air pollution.    Improving energy efficiency and increasing the amount of energy coming from renewable sources also  helps slow climate change, which is increasingly shown to affect human health. Vector-borne diseases,  like  malaria  or  West  Nile  virus,  can  shift  range  under  global  warming.  Increased  risk  from  natural  disasters, like droughts, heat waves, floods, landslides, intense hurricanes (typhoons) and other extreme  weather  events  are  linked  to  climate  change  and  pose  direct  threats  to  health.  The  effects  on  agriculture,  livelihoods,  mental  health,  population  displacement  and  conflict  have  direct  impacts  on  health. In a 2012 report, DARA estimated that climate change was already responsible for an additional  400,000  deaths  in  2010.  Inequity  is  an  important  aspect  of  this  relationship  since  a  disproportionate  burden is borne by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.    Health  and  its  relationship  with  securing  ecosystem  services  and  biodiversity,  and  ensuring  good  management of water and other natural resources: Research in health is increasingly showing linkages                                                               7 For more information, see the publications from the SDSN Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities: Inclusive, Resilient, and  Connected at http://unsdsn.org/thematicgroups/tg9.   28    between  environment  and  health.  The  role  of  ecology  is  evident  in  the  rise  of  new  infections,  particularly zoonotic infections resulting from the interface between humans and domestic animals in  processes such as deforestation and livestock farming. Air and water pollution also impact health and  the  effects  of  marine  pollution  on  seafood  are  a  significant  threat  to  the  health  of  the  coastal  poor.  Freshwater  is  essential  for  human  life.  Potable  water  is  needed  for  daily  drinking  and  cooking.  Contaminated  water  is  a  cause  of  many  infectious  diseases,  especially  childhood  diarrhea  that  is  the  second leading cause of under-5 mortality. Water is also needed for personal hygiene (bathing, hand- washing) and ablutions. As the availability of clean water is reduced, health is endangered. Protecting  our water resources is an essential component of the SDG framework. UHC, implemented with an equity  lens provides a safety net to buffer the effects and impact of the environment on human health.    Health  and  transforming  governance  for  sustainable  development:  Trade  and  investment  policies  related  to  essential  drugs,  vaccines,  commodities,  health-relevant  technologies,  agricultural  produce,  food  products,  tobacco,  alcohol  and  international  agreements  related  to  services  (including  health  worker  migration)  have  important  implications  for  health.  While  trade  and  investment  policies  have  largely remained agnostic or sometimes even antagonistic to public health concerns in the past, in the  post-2015 development framework they need to become more sensitive and better aligned to public  health  priorities,  in  keeping  with  the  goals  of  sustainable  development.  Additionally,  the  provision  of  UHC depends on adequate financial resources. All high-income countries should provide 0.7% of gross  national income (GNI) in ODA, with 0.1% earmarked for health.   There are also strong linkages between poor governance, civil conflict and ill health. Political instability  and  sociocultural  challenges  have  impeded  the  achievement  of  basic  health  targets  of  immunization  linked to diseases that are eradicable. The cases of polio from northern Nigeria, Afghanistan, and lately,  parts of Pakistan, provide daily challenges in implementation of immunization programs and personal  safety of medical staff in sensitive areas. These factors have led to disparities in commitment towards  health  policy,  in  implementation  of  programs  and  in  the  resulting  health  outcomes.  Global  economic  slowdown (recession) and resulting austerity measures by governments have affected public systems of  health (apart from other social sectors) and have further exacerbated health disparities.               29   Health in All Policies: Case of Tobacco Control  According to the WHO, 100 million persons died due to tobacco related diseases in the 20th century.  WHO also estimates that the death toll due to tobacco will be one billion human lives in the 21st  century. Sustainable development is inconceivable and unachievable, if the elimination of tobacco is  not an integral part of the framework for development.   Tobacco is not only a health hazard. It is a threat to the environment through deforestation (wood  fuel is burnt for curing wood and cigarette machines use 4 miles of paper an hour), extensive  pesticide use, high levels of water and soil nutrients depleted for cultivation, soil erosion and  strewing of butts. It is a fire hazard, responsible for dangerous domestic and forest fires. It is  unacceptable that around 4 million hectares of arable land are wasted on a killer crop instead of  growing nutrient crops. Across the world, poor consume tobacco more frequently and consumption  of tobacco products is a cause of families being pushed into poverty.   Recognizing this multi-dimensional nature of tobacco related harm to several areas of human  development, WHO developed the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC). 177 countries  have ratified the first ever international public health treaty since its adoption in 2003. The treaty  provisions call for actions across multiple sectors: raising tobacco taxes; comprehensive bans on all  forms of advertising, sponsorship and promotion; bans on smoking in public and work places; strong  rotating health warnings on tobacco products packs; control of illicit trade; support for cessation  programs; provision of economically viable alternate livelihoods to tobacco farmers and workers;  integration of tobacco control in health, education, development and poverty reduction programs.  WHO also developed the MPOWER policy package to assist countries in implementing the FCTC.  Raising tobacco taxes is an especially promising policy, as they raise revenue for health services  within the UHC model while reducing the burden of future health care costs on the system.   As the FCTC is implemented by governments in both HICs and LMICs, we can expect to see an  increase in overall health, a decrease in costs associated with health care as tobacco-related diseases  decrease, and an increase of available funds at the household level for education, food, and/or  housing.    Tobacco Control also exemplifies the need for a life-course approach, commencing from protection  of the unborn child to cessation at any age. Health services too must integrate tobacco control within  the ambit of UHC, both for prevention of primary uptake and promotion of cessation.    30    Appendix 1: Targets and Indicators  In the SDSN Report An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 goals were proposed for the period 2015-2030. While nearly all 10 goals  have implications for health, the most relevant are goals 1 and 5, for which we propose the following indicators:   GOAL 1: End Extreme Poverty including Hunger   Target 1A. End absolute income poverty ($1.25 or less per day) and hunger, including achieving food security and appropriate nutrition, and  ending child stunting (MDG 1).

It includes  several  measures  for  reducing  the  demand  and  supply  of  tobacco  products,  with  the  aim  of  reducing  the  prevalence  of  tobacco  consumption  globally  and  thereby  reducing  the  harm  to  health from tobacco exposure. It was adopted in 2003 by the World Health Assembly and came  into force in 2005. The treaty has now been ratified by 177 countries.    Harmful tobacco/alcohol use:  Excessive use to the point that it causes damage to health and  often  includes  adverse  social  consequences  (WHO).  The  Alcohol  Use  Disorders  Identification  Test (AUDIT) is recommended.  NTDs: Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of  parasitic and bacterial diseases that cause substantial illness for more than one billion of the  world's poorest people. NTDs affect physical and cognitive development, in turn reducing  productivity in both the long and short terms, and often also carry social stigmatization.  Examples include leprosy, rabies, Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis),  river blindness (onchocerciasis), schistosomiasis, and Guinea-worm disease (dracunculiasis).   Health  equity:  Refers  to  ideals  of  fairness  and  social  justice.  Inequities  in  health  refer  to  disparities within and between countries, that are judged to be unfair, unjust, avoidable, and  unnecessary  (neither  inevitable  nor  irremediable)  and  that  systematically  burden  populations  rendered  vulnerable  by  underlying  social  structures  and  political,  economic,  and  legal  institutions.   Out of Pocket Spending (OOPS): Out of pocket expenditure is any direct outlay by households,  including  gratuities  and  in-kind  payments,  to  health  practitioners  and  suppliers  of  pharmaceuticals, therapeutic appliances, and other goods and services whose primary intent is  to  contribute  to  the  restoration  or  enhancement  of  the  health  status  of  individuals  or  population groups. It is a part of private health expenditure.   Primary  Health  Care  (PHC):  Primary  health  care  is  essential  health  care  based  on  practical,  scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible  to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that  the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the  spirit  of  self-reliance  and  self-determination.  It  forms  an  integral  part  both  of  the  country's  health system, of which it is the central function and main focus, and of the overall social and  economic development of the community. It is the first level of contact for individuals with the  national health system, bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work,  and  constitutes  the  first  element  of  a  continuing  health  care  process.  (Alma  Ata  Declaration,  1978)   Social Capital: Social capital refers to the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the  quality  and  quantity  of  a  society's  social  interactions.  Increasing  evidence  shows  that  social  cohesion is critical for societies to prosper economically and for development to be sustainable.  36    Social capital is not just the sum of the institutions that underpin a society  it is the glue that  holds them together. (World Bank)   Subjective  Wellbeing: Refers to how people evaluate their lives, both at the moment and for  longer periods (such as for the past year). This includes emotional reactions to events, moods,  and judgments about life satisfaction and fulllment, as well as satisfaction with domains such  as marriage and work. (Diener 2003)   Sustainable  Development:  Development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs.  (Brundtland  Commission, 1987)   Universal Health Coverage (UHC):  The goal of UHC is to ensure that all people obtain the health  services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them. For a community  or country to achieve universal health coverage, several factors must be in place, including:  1. A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority health needs through people- centered integrated care (including services for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, NTDs, and  other communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health  and rights, and maternal and child health) by:    Detecting health conditions and risk factors early;   Having the capacity to treat disease; and   Helping patients with rehabilitation.  Informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness;  2. Affordability    a  system  for  financing  health  services  so  people  do  not  suffer  financial  hardship when using them. This can be achieved in a variety of ways.  3. Access to essential medicines, commodities, and technologies to diagnose and treat medical  problems.  4. A sufficient capacity of well trained, motivated health workers to provide quality services to  meet patients needs based on the best available evidence. (WHO 2012)  5.

Some of these  have been initiated under the auspices of UN agencies while civil society groups led others.

Report of The United Nations  Sustainable Development  Solutions Network (June 2013)        39   Appendix 4: Evidence for Universal Health Coverage Indicators  Rationale for financial protection and financial resources for health indicators  A key component of UHC is to ensure that everyone has protection from the risk of incurring  costs  associated  with  using  health  services.  Effective  financial  risk  protection  in  the  health  systems  context  particularly  involves  protecting  individuals  and  families  against  (further)  impoverishment from spending on health.    Building on the globally established body of work and accumulated experience and evaluation in  a wide range of countries, we propose the following key indicator:    Impoverishing  expenditure:  the  percentage  of  the  population  pushed  below,  or  further  below, the PPP$2 poverty line, as a result of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments to use health  services in the past month.  It is critical that global efforts to eradicate extreme poverty are  not undermined by impoverishing expenditure to use needed health services.   Given  the  differential  geographic  access  to  health  services,  we  propose  that  this  indicator  focuses  not  only  on  OOP  payments  to  a  health  care  provider  or  for  medicines,  but  also  OOP  payments  for  transport  to  use  services.  Both  these  indicators  are  easily  computable  in  all  countries  using  household  budget  surveys,  and  estimates  currently  exist  for  most  countries,  permitting easy estimation of baseline estimates when monitoring progress toward targets.  In  terms of the targets that should be set, we propose that the level of impoverishing expenditures  be  set  at  zero,  recognizing  that  the  concept  of  UHC  requires  the  complete  elimination  of  all  financial hardship when accessing health care.    Although this indicator provides important insights into the extent to which a country is (or is  not) providing adequate financial protection for its residents, it is not feasible to move towards  UHC through providing such financial protection in the absence of adequate levels of domestic  public funding15, with associated decreases in voluntary payments, accompanied by continued  donor funding support in lower-income countries. It is, thus, critical to include specific indicators  that  encourage  changes  in  financing  sources  that  will  promote  UHC.   We  propose  three  key  indicators in this regard.   First,  all  countries  should  make  progress  to  domestic  public  funding  for  health  care  of  5%  of  GDP16.   A  small  number  of  countries  have  made  progress  to  UHC  goals  with  lower  levels  of  funding, but this is the exception and requires extremely high levels of efficiency that are very                                                               15 Domestic public funding is defined as including all sources of mandatory pre-payment funding, including  government revenue and possibly also mandatory health insurance.  16 At present, the only target relating to government spending on health care that is widely used is the Abuja target,  which calls for at least 15% of total government spending to be devoted to the health sector.  We believe it is  preferable to express the public sending target as a percentage of GDP for several reasons. Specifying a target in  terms of increasing the health sectors share of government expenditure implies that spending on other sectors  should decline, which could undermine spending on other social services and hence adversely affect other social  determinants of health.  Instead, there is an urgent need to increase public spending on health services as well as  other social sectors.  Given the large variability in government revenues and expenditure across countries, which is  not strongly correlated with level of economic development, it is problematic to set a target relative to the  government budget, in that it does not exert pressure on governments to ensure maximum available resources as  committed to in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  40      which shows that public health expenditure of 6% of GDP is generally required to limit OOP  payments to a maximum of 20% of total health expenditure);   To promote access to needed health care (proxied by achieving 90% coverage for  difficult to achieve.  There is a growing evidence base that a minimum public funding level of 5%  of  GDP  is  usually  required  to  make  considerable  progress  to  UHC.   Recent  analyses  of  the  relationship  between  public  spending  on  health  as  a  %  of  GDP  and  key  indicators  of  health  status, financial protection and service coverage point to 5% of GDP being an appropriate target  (McIntyre & Meheus 2013).  This evidence can be summarized as follows:   To dramatically improve health status (e.g. reduce IMR to 10 per 1,000 live births) generally  requires government spending of above 5% of GDP;   To reduce financial catastrophe and impoverishment to negligible levels requires reducing  out-of-pocket payments to 15-20% of total health expenditure (World Health Organization  2010), which in turn requires government spending of more than 5% of GDP (see Figure 5  immunizations and deliveries by skilled birth attendants, and to achieve the global average  of 44 core medical professionals per 10,000 population) requires government spending of  5% of GDP or more.  Figure 5: Relationship between government health spending and dependence on out-of- pocket payments (2010)   Source: Updated from McIntyre and Kutzin (2011)   A target of around 5% of GDP is supported by global analyses undertaken for the 2010 World  Health Report on financing for UHC.  Two observations from that report are particularly  pertinent:    Those countries whose entire populations have access to a set of services usually have  relatively high levels of [mandatory] pooled funds  in the order of 56% of gross domestic  product (GDP) (World Health Organization 2010: xv)    41  General government health spending as a percentage of gross domestic product indicates  the  capacity  and  will  of  government  to  shield  the  population  from  the  costs  of  care.  It  is  difficult to get close to universal coverage at less than 45% of GDP, although for many low-  and  middle-income  countries,  reaching  this  goal  is  aspirational  in  the  short  term  and  something to plan for in the longer run (World Health Organization 2010: 98)  level,  and  avoiding  reductions   Finally, using data from the World Health Statistics dataset, the global average of government  health care expenditure is 5.1% of GDP.   It is recognized that public spending on health is far lower than this in other countries (ranging  from  an  average  of  3.6%  of  GDP  in  upper-middle  income  countries  to  2.2%  of  GDP  in  low- income countries).  Thus, as noted in the 2010 World Health Report, the target of 5% of GDP in  public spending on health is an aspirational goal for low- and middle-income countries, and we  recommend that these countries at least make progress towards this goal and reduce by half the  gap between 5% of GDP and their current public funding levels.   Public  spending  on  health  exceeds  the  5%  of  GDP  level  in  almost  all  high-income  OECD  countries,  with  an  overall  average  of  public  spending  of  6.9%  of  GDP  for  all  high-income  countries.  While setting a separate, higher target for high-income countries may be desirable,  there has been no published analysis to establish what an appropriate public spending level in  these countries would be.  High-income countries should at least aspire to exceeding the 5% of  GDP  public  spending  in  current  public  spending  unless  demonstrated  efficiency  gains  can  be  achieved  (where  efficiency  is  distinct  from  cost- containment, and can be defined as producing the same outputs with fewer resources while not  compromising quality of care).   Second, international experience clearly indicates that countries that have made considerable  progress to UHC fund their health services predominantly from domestic public (i.e. mandatory  pre-payment)  sources  (generally  comprising  70%  or  more;  see  Figure  6  for  original  OECD  countries and some LMICs with considerable progress to UHC).  Conversely, as explicitly stated  in the 2010 World Health Report, it is not possible to achieve UHC through voluntary payments  for health care.  On this basis, we recommend an indicator that OOP payments and voluntary  health insurance contributions comprise a maximum of 30% of total health care expenditure.   Finally, continued donor funding support is required for low-income countries to provide PHC  services  and  basic  referral  services.   Even  if  these  countries  achieved  the  target  of  domestic  public spending on health of 5% of GDP, they would be spending no more than US$58 per capita  on  health  services  (with  several  spending  less  that  US$20  per  capita).   This  is  well  below  the  necessary per capita spending levels for such services, which is estimated to be US$86 in 2012  terms  (updated  by  McIntyre  and  Meheus  (2013)  from  the  calculations  of  the  Commission  on  Macroeconomics  and  Health  and  the  High  Level  Task  Force  on  Innovative  International  Financing for Health Systems).  We recommend that all high-income countries devote 0.1% of  their GNI to ODA for health services.  Several upper-middle-income countries are beginning to  provide  ODA  funding  on  a  voluntary  basis.   We  recommend  that  there  should  be  an  explicit  requirement for any country reaching high-income status to provide ODA for health and other  social services, in line with the need for shared responsibility for global human development.    42    100%# 90%# 80%# 70%# 60%# 50%# 40%# 30%# 20%# 10%# ' e r u t i d n e p x e e r a c ' h t l a e h ' ' l a t o t ' f o ' t n e c r e P 0%# Australia# Austria# Belgium# Canada# Denmark# Finland# France# Germany# Ireland# Italy# New#Zealand# Netherlands# Japan# Norway# Portugal# Spain# United#Kingdom# Switzerland# Sweden# Costa#Rica# Thailand# Cuba# Mandatory#preSpayment# Voluntary#preSpayment# OutSofSpocket#  Figure 6: Financing sources for UHC.   Source: Data derived from WHO National Health Accounts dataset   It will be important to take global action to improve low- and middle-income countries ability to  generate  domestic  public  funds  for  health  and  other  social  services,  such  as  to  reduce  tax  avoidance by high-net worth individuals and transnational companies, address tax competition  between countries, ensure that government revenue from minerals and other natural resources  are maximized and addressing unfair trade practices.  However, this will take considerable time  to achieve, and hence continued ODA is required in the interim.   In line with the emphasis in this report on the importance of PHC, the limited financial resources  available  from  domestic  public  and  ODA  sources  in  low-income  countries  should  be  devoted  exclusively to PHC services (which include core referral services).  In middle-income countries,  comprehensive  PHC  services  should  again  be  the  main  focus  for  the  use  of  public  financial  resources, expanding to a wider range of services over time as GDP (and hence public funding of  health  services  at  a  level  of  5%  of  GDP)  increases.   Within  high-income  countries,  it  may  be  necessary to assess whether PHC services are being given sufficient priority, given that there is  frequently too heavy an emphasis on tertiary care in these countries.   Rationale for service use indicators   The second core component of UHC is that everyone within a country should be able to access  needed, quality health services. The ultimate goal of this element of UHC is that those who need  care  actually  use  services  and  that  these  services  effectively  address  health  care  needs.   The  ideal in assessing achievement of this aspect of UHC is to evaluate if everyone who has a need  for health care actually uses the appropriate service.  This requires that one is able to measure  both the numerator (use of services) and denominator (need for health care) accurately.  It is  easiest to do this for individual services, particularly where the denominator can be accurately  estimated  on  the  basis  of  demographic  data  (such  as  for  immunization  coverage  of  young  children  or  antenatal  visits  and  assisted  delivery  by  a  qualified  health  worker  for  pregnant   43   women).  Given the ease of measurement, it is unsurprising that measures of maternal and child  health services are the most frequently measured and reported indicators.  However, there have  been criticisms of this narrow focus on maternal and child health services.  Indicators have also  been  put  forward  for  measuring  treatment  in  relation  to  communicable  diseases,  particularly  TB, HIV and malaria.  More recently, efforts have been made to estimate the need for and use of  non-communicable  diseases  (NCDs),  particularly  hypertension  and  diabetes.   We  recommend  that  indicators  of  coverage  include  maternal  and  child  health,  communicable  and  non- communicable disease services, with an additional set of indicators for countries where data are  already available.   While these indicators provide very valuable insights into how the health system is performing  in  relation  to  specific  services,  they  only  do  so  for  a  very  small  sample  of  the  hundreds  of  different health services provided.  An alternative approach is to focus on measuring total use of  outpatient and inpatient services, i.e. average number of outpatient visits per person per year  and  average  number  of  admissions  per  1,000  people  per  year.   This  would  provide  a  more  comprehensive indication of the use of the full range of health services.  Although it is difficult  to determine what level of outpatient service utilization is needed within a particular country, as  this  is  influenced  by  its  demographic  and  epidemiological  profile,  we  recommend  basic  minimum utilization rates that all countries should achieve.  We propose relatively conservative  thresholds for assessing whether a country has achieved UHC.  These thresholds lie at the lower  end of the ranges of levels observed in countries that are generally recognized as having made  considerable progress to UHC. For outpatient services, the threshold rate required would be 4  visits per capita per year. This compares with average rates of 6.5 in OECD countries, and rates  of  4-6  in  developing  countries  with  UHC.  For  inpatient  services,  we  propose  a  rate  of  70  per  1,000 people per year. This is at the lower end of the range observed in both developed and  developing countries with UHC today (the OECD average is 158 per 1,000).  WHO has proposed  similar but higher levels in its SARA tool.   We recognize that these measures of utilization provide no indication of the appropriateness or  quality  of  care  delivered.   Nevertheless,  utilization  levels  below  these  targets  will  at  least  provide  an  indication  of  the  extent  of  unmet  need 17.   We  recommend  that  each  country  supplement these utilization indicators with a critical analysis of the appropriateness of service  use and quality of care delivered.                                                                  17 This draws on detailed assessments of minimum utilisation rates of appropriate services to address needed care  within individual countries, such as the Need Norms project in South Africa (Rispel et al., 1996), estimate  utilisation rates for different categories of outpatient (particularly PHC) services where there are minimal barriers  to health services.  These estimates include preventive and promotive services (e.g. number of visits to ensure full  immunisation of children and antenatal care for pregnant women) and curative care for acute and chronic  conditions, drawing on the demographic and epidemiological profile within that country.  44    Appendix 5: Universal Health Care as being built on the foundation of human rights and equity16 Whilst  the  health  MDGs  rightly  encouraged  overall  improvements  in  population  health  outcomes,  concerns  regarding  equity  within  societies  remained  largely  unaddressed.  Large  or  growing  health  disparities  have  remained  major  barriers  for realization  of  human  capabilities,  and  in  the  ability  of  people  to  live  a  life  with  dignity.  In  essence,  this  contradicts  the  shared  fundamental value of equality that is espoused in the Millennium Declaration.   The  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  in  1948  recognized  the  right  of  everyone  to  a  standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family, including  food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security  in the event of unemployment, sickness. Similarly, the UN International Covenant on Economic,  Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 has guaranteed the \"right of everyone to the enjoyment of the  highest attainable standard of health. Both of these declarations have called for the creation  of  conditions  which  could  assure  to  all  medical  service  and  medical  attention  in  the  event  of  sickness.\"  The  SDGs  offer  another  such  opportunity.  However,  this  would  require  a  shared  commitment  to  a  global  health  development  agenda  that  facilitates  and  promotes  the  development  of  health  systems  and  policies,  guaranteeing  all  individuals  accessible  and  affordable  health,  including  health  prevention  and  promotion  dimensions,  healthcare  services  and financial protection when needed. These fundamental rights were recently re-affirmed in a  UN General Assembly resolution on UHC passed unanimously in December 2012. This resolution  also  explicitly  recognized  that  inadequate  coverage  levels  at  present  were  compromising  the  attainment of these rights:   Noting  with  particular  concern  that  for  millions  of  people  the  right  to  the  enjoyment  of  the  highest  attainable  standard  of  physical  and  mental  health,  including  access  to  medicines,  remains a distant goal, that especially for children and those living in poverty, the likelihood of  achieving this goal is becoming increasingly remote, that millions of people are driven below the  poverty line each year because of catastrophic out-of-pocket payments for health care and that  excessive out of pocket payments can discourage the impoverished from seeking or continuing  care.   To  redress  this  situation,  the  recent  UN  General  Assembly  Resolution  emphasizes  the  importance  of  achieving  universal  population  coverage.  Specifically  it  acknowledges  that  universal  health  coverage  implies  that  all  people  have  access,  without  discrimination,  to  nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative basic  health  services  and  essential,  safe,  affordable,  effective  and  quality  medicines,  while  ensuring  that  the  use  of  these  services  does  not  expose  the  users  to  financial  hardship,  with  a  special  emphasis on the poor, vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population.   Universal means that any strategy leaving any person (especially people with greater needs or  with fewer financial resources) uncovered is unacceptable. Fulfilling this commitment does not  imply using the same financing sources or same providers. If economically advantaged sections  of society choose to purchase health services using out-of-pocket financing or private insurance  schemes then they should be free to do so. However, selective health strategies catering to the   45   preferences  of  privileged  groups  and  ignoring  the  needs  of  the  poor  are  fundamentally  inequitable and contravene rights based approaches.   The  post-2015  development  agenda  must  ensure  that  countries  reach  UHC  equitably,  with  health  service  benefits  distributed  according  to  need  and  pre-paid  financial  contributions  determined  by  ones  ability  to  pay.  Only  then  will  health  systems  and  policies  be  compatible  with the core global values of freedom, solidarity, equality and human security, which motivated  the MDG process.   Embedding progress towards attainment of UHC as a common global priority and development  goal in the post-MDG framework addresses the longstanding failure of the global development  agenda  to  incorporate  the  internationally  accepted  right  to  health.  This  right  must  guarantee  effective  and  equitable  access  to  healthcare  services  as  well  as  security  against  financial  risks  from illness as basic elements of human wellbeing.         46    Appendix 6: Examples of policies that can result in health benefits and reductions in greenhouse pollutant emissions, with potential indicators18 Strategy to reduce  greenhouse  pollutant emissions  Reduced fossil fuel  combustion  (particularly coal) to  generate electricity  Main greenhouse  pollutants involved  Carbon dioxide (plus  methane and black  carbon)  Mechanism linking  reduced GHP  emissions to health  benefits  Reduction in fine  particulate air pollution  Health outcomes  affected  Mortality and morbidity  due to cardiorespiratory  diseases  Improved efficiency  cook stoves in  households burning  biomass or coal in open  fires on inefficient  stoves.

In the simplest definition it is the lack of household income (or consumption). The World Bank measures income (or consumption) poverty using a poverty line of $1.25 per day in $US 2005 purchasing-power- adjusted terms. The Headcount Poverty Rate, or HPR, measures the proportion of households in a country living below this international poverty line. More generally, poverty means the inability to meet basic needs, including food, shelter, clothing, water and sanitation, education, and healthcare. In this sense, poverty generally reflects a combination of income poverty at the household level and poverty at the community level in the provision of basic infrastructure and public services. In principle a comprehensive poverty map would identify people living in poverty as a result of low household income or inadequate community services, and would identify targeted solutions to poverty based on the precise nature of poverty. This kind of analysis can be made at the local and national level, but the requisite data do not exist at the global level. There are several basic causes of extreme poverty. These include: (1) Adverse geographical condition:  Physical isolation of the region (landlocked, small island, mountainous) and sparseness of the population  Poor climate (hyper arid, flood prone)  Poor agriculture (poor soils, land degradation, adverse climate) or poor fisheries  Lack of energy resources (no fossil fuels, no hydro power)  Disease ecology (hyper-endemic vector-borne diseases such as malaria)  Major vulnerability to hazards such as floods, droughts, typhoons, earthquakes and other hazards The Horn of Africa and the Sahel are examples of regions with highly adverse geographical conditions: landlocked, generally devoid of fossil fuels, hyper-arid and drought prone, and endemic to tropical diseases, including malaria and meningitis. Many small-island states are geographically isolated. Within large middle-income countries extreme poverty is often highest in remote interior provinces (e.g. the West of China and the North-East of India). (2) Prolonged violent conflict and international sanctions The incidence of extreme poverty is highly correlated with violent conflict and instability. Afghanistan has been reduced to misery through thirty years of nearly continuous conflict. Likewise, Haitis economy was ravaged by repeated episodes of international sanctions. (3) Despotic government and poor governance Poor governance, including high levels of corruption and the systematic misallocation of a countrys resources away from the needs of the poor, are an important determinant of extreme poverty. North Korea is the quintessential case of despotic rule leading to extreme poverty despite otherwise favorable economic potential. The failure by some of the resource-rich countries in Africa to use their relative wealth to overcome the disadvantages of unfavorable geography is another potent example of poor governance. (4) Gender and ethnic or social discrimination Indigenous peoples (roughly 400 million around the world) and other excluded groups have faced centuries of extreme discrimination and social exclusion. As a result they tend to live in the most remote parts of countries (c.f. adverse geography above) and constitute a particularly high share of the extreme poor, particularly in Asia. Girls and women continue to face extreme discrimination in social practices and legal rights (e.g. the right to land title) in many parts of the world, which increases the risk of extreme poverty for households. (5) Extreme total fertility rates (6 or higher) Rural areas in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia, and Central Asia have total fertility rates of 6 or higher. These higher TFRs result from culture (religious tenets, gender discrimination), the lack of girls schooling, high child mortality (leading to high fertility choices of households), and the unavailability of contraceptives and family planning services. High TFRs are one of the most important determinants of extreme poverty since they reduce a households per capita investment in the health and education of its children as well as a governments per capita investments in infrastructure and social services that can reduce poverty. (6) Lack of access to land While most of the rural poor in Africa own (too little) land, many extreme poor in South Asia have no land title. The lack of access to land and a lack of gainful employment opportunities can constitute an important driver of extreme poverty. Where the Poor Live Using the World Banks measure of extreme income poverty, there are around 1.2 billion people in extreme poverty. Around 26 percent of those, mainly in sub- Saharan Africa, live in low-income countries as classified by the World Bank (below $1,025 GDP per person in 2011). Another 58 percent, mainly in Asia, live in lower- middle-income countries (between $1,026 and $4,035 GDP per person) such as China, India, and Indonesia. Around 17 percent of the extreme poor live in upper- middle-income countries. The high proportion (74%) of the extreme poor living in middle income countries is not entirely surprising given that the MICs account for approximately 86% of the population of the developing world. Nor are the lower-income-countries that are home to the greatest proportion of the worlds poorest people safely out of the low- income country zone where extreme poverty can be endemic. India, Nigeria, and many other LMICs face enormous challenges of maintaining high and inclusive economic growth, in view of highly challenging demographic, environmental, and social factors. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the worlds poorest region and the one with the highest headcount poverty rate (around 48%). South Asia is second (around 36%), and Southeast Asia is third. There is scattered extreme poverty in other parts of the world (such as in the Andean highlands, Haiti, indigenous communities in Central America, and small island states). While these pockets of poverty pose serious humanitarian and social challenges for the people and places involved, they are a small proportion of the overall global challenge.

A new update, IDS Working Paper, Volume 2012 No. 393, June 2012 When we look across all poverty indicators, in Table 2, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are the two centers of global poverty and the two regions demanding the most international support. Of these two regions, sub-Saharan Africa, with lower income than South Asia, faces the greater challenge and need. While the two regions account for approximately 45% of the population of the developing countries, they account for a much higher proportion of poverty in its various manifestations, generally well over 70%:1 75% of the income poverty 63% of the chronically hungry 72% of the children out of school 75% of the illiterate adults 86% of the people living with HIV/AIDS 94%+ of the malaria deaths 84% of the Under-5 Mortality 86% of the Maternal Mortality 87% of those practicing open defecation 73% of the stunted children Where are the ultra-poor? It is difficult to accurately measure the distribution of poverty below the $1.25 line. Several attempts have been made, notably by IFPRI, who divide the poor into ultra poor (below half the poverty line), medial poor (between half and  of the poverty line) and subjacent poor (above  of the poverty line). The 2004 breakdown of poverty is summarized in Figure 1. 1 We underscore the approximate nature of these calculations, given the many uncertainties in the underlying data. Figure 1: Where the poor live in the Developing world, 2004 (Source: Akhter U. Ahmed, Ruth Vargas Hill, Doris M. Wiesmann (2009) The Poorest and Hungry: Looking Below the Line. In: Joachim von Braun, Ruth Vargas Hill, Rajul Pandya-Lorch (eds.) The Poorest and Hungry. Assessment, Analyses, and Actions. IFPRI, Washington D.C.) Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for some  of the worlds ultra poor. These ultra poor exhibit all the attributes of the extreme poor described above, but in greater depth. They are located in the most remote areas, part of excluded groups, have extremely high TFRs, and so forth. As a result, many find themselves in a poverty trap, which they cannot exit without pro-active anti-poverty strategies. Anti-Poverty Strategies The post-2015 goals should include the ambition to end extreme poverty. This is certainly feasible by 2030. Between 1990 and 2010, the HPR for the developing world declined from around 44% to 22%. The conditions for reducing the HPR to near zero are propitious if the strategies are correct. The nature of poverty and the policy implications are somewhat different in the cases of poor people in low-income countries (mainly sub-Saharan Africa), and poor people in lower-middle-income countries, mainly in Asia. In the case of poor people in poor countries, national government lacks the domestic resource base to break the poverty trap on their own. Moreover, there may be few opportunities to relieve poverty through internal migration from poor regions to wealthier regions within the country (such as from poor rural areas to dynamic urban areas). In the case of poor people living in lower-middle-income countries, by contrast, national governments command more domestic resources for investing in poverty reduction, and there may be more scope as well for internal migration, typically from rural to urban areas. For Low-Income Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa faces an enormous burden of investment needs, to build core infrastructure (power, roads, rail, water and sanitation, fiber optics, and more), as well as the need to overcome deficits of energy, disease burden, irrigation, and other climate vulnerabilities. Excessive fertility rates mean that Sub-Saharan Africas population, around 856 million (2010), is on a trajectory to exceed 3.3 billion by 2100, on the UNs medium-fertility forecast. A population anywhere near that level would spell devastation for Africas ecosystems and its poor people, especially in the face of growing risks from global human-induced climate change. The regions high-priority anti-poverty challenges include:  Financing infrastructure (electricity, roads, rail, water and sanitation)  Universal health care coverage  Reducing fertility rates to below 3.0 (from a current average of 4.8, and much higher in rural areas)  Universal access to schooling through secondary level  Upgrading rural agriculture through support for smallholder farmers Improved governance and accountability to make the above possible  All of these are actionable, practical, and feasible. Together they would enable both rural and urban Africa to break out the poverty trap. They require a mix of private and public financing. Infrastructure financing might need to increase by around $100 billion per year, mainly financed by private capital with some public sweeteners. Social spending might require a boost of around $100 billion, around half of which should come from official development assistance. These countries should graduate from development assistance by 2030. For Lower-Middle-Income Countries in South and Southeast Asia These countries (notably India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam) still have major pockets of poverty, hundreds of millions of mainly rural people, and often shockingly high levels of childhood under-nutrition. Social programs need to be greatly enhanced, and subsidy programs need to be much better targeted on the poor. Gender discrimination continues to impede progress, for example in northern India. Countries with very high rates of stunting should focus on integrated strategies for early childhood development: safe pregnancy and childbirth, young childrens health and nutrition, pre-school, and healthy childcare. Note that the countries of South and Southeast Asia are extremely vulnerable to global climate change. All are densely populated with a high vulnerability to droughts, floods, and groundwater depletion. Some, such as Bangladesh, would be devastated by a significant rise in the ocean level. Global climate-change mitigation (reducing the pace and extent of human-induced climate change), as well as domestic policies to promote climate resilience and population stabilization (through further voluntary reductions in fertility rates) are vital to the success of the long-term and sustainable elimination of extreme poverty of these countries.

Found in every crevice and corner of every habitat on Earth, from the alpine tundra of the Tibetan Plateau to the deepest parts of the Mariana Trench, millions of plant, animal, and microbial species work day in and day out providing us with benefits valued in the trillions of dollars. Much of these benefits are invisible, such as maintaining Earths stratospheric ozone layer that shields us from harmful radiation or pumping unwanted atmospheric carbon into the oceans depths or in the trees of a forest. The productivity our forests, farms, and fisheries, however, are highly visible benefits. They are the sources of our food, fiber, materials, and fuels and the foundation of our health, well-being, and national wealth and the more diverse they are the more productive and robust they will be. Thus, preserving biodiversity and wisely managing our ecosystems ensures environmental sustainability, which is the necessary precursor to achieving sustainable development. It is important to note here that the SDSN fully supports the Rio+20 vision of sustainable development as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions of society: economic development (including the end of extreme poverty), social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and good governance including peace and security. Life on earth, however, is undergoing significant change, making the pathway to environmental sustainability extraordinarily challenging. Habitat degradation, overfishing, climate change, and the human transport of invasive species, pests and pathogens, have led to enormous losses of forested ecosystems, the collapse of major fisheries, and the decline in the majority of services ecosystems provide. Fortunately, biodiversity and ecosystem services have been under intense scientific investigation since 1992, following on the heels of the Earth Summit in Rio. Today, some solutions to the challenges of achieving environmental sustainability are to hand. However, much more can and needs to be done. Sustaining Life as a Thematic Group A network of solutions Achieving sustainable development is not just about economics and environment, but about meeting a wide array of interconnected challenges. These challenges include finding solutions to food, energy, and water security, improving health, alleviating hunger and poverty, and wisely managing biodiversity and ecosystem services. No single challenge among these will find its solution in isolation. Sustainable solutions to poverty, health, and hunger, for example, are strongly tied to solutions to securing ecosystem services, such as the provisioning of food and materials by forests, agro-ecosystems, the provisioning of water by watersheds, healthy and productive ocean and coasts. To mobilize science and technology and to accelerate problem solving for sustainable development, the General-Secretary of the United Nations has established the Sustainable   3  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145   Development Solutions Network (SDSN). Jeffrey Sachs serves as its director and Guido Schmidt-Traub its executive director, and an Executive Committee and Leadership Council comprised of world leaders in sustainable development from across all sectors brought together to develop integrative solutions. The Solutions Network is organized into twelve thematic groups (Box 1), each representing a node made up of experts drawn from academia, civil society, local and indigenous representatives and the private sector to develop integrated solutions to the complex challenges that confront those working towards meeting sustainable development goals. Forests, Oceans, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (FOBES) Of the twelve Thematic Groups, the one centered on biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services is entitled, Forest, Oceans, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (FOBES). This Thematic Group serves as the network node for scientific and technical expertise centered on biodiversity and ecosystem services. It interacts with all other SDSN nodes and serves all sectors seeking integrative solutions to sustainable development. One of its chief functions is to help inform the establishment of goals, targets, and indicators. In that sense, the FOBES thematic group has been actively involved in the preparation of the report prepared by the SDSN for the UN Secretary General An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, the FOBES group will contribute to bolster a discussion around potential targets and indicators to measure the success towards Goal 9 proposed by this Action Agenda: Secure ecosystem services and biodiversity, and ensure good management of water and other natural resources.

Somewhere on the order of ten million species populate earths ecosystems. Weighing at over a trillion tons of biomass, half of which consists of beneficial microbes in our soils, sediments, and oceans, these species cycle billions of tons of carbon, nutrients, and other elements among the biomes and ecosystems of the earth. Through their biological, chemical, and physical work, this diversity of life on earth, or biodiversity, is what make our soils fertile, water potable, air breathable, climate   4  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174   equitable, and ecosystems productive. They also regulate climate, flooding, the spread of infectious diseases, and control agricultural pests, invasive species, and provide pollination services for our orchards and vegetable crops. Valuations of these services, from greenhouse gas regulation by forests to markets for wild-caught fish, range in the billions, sometimes trillions of dollars annually for individual services. Biodiversity, ecosystem services, and our basic livelihood and well-being are inextricably linked. The relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services is complex, but increasingly understood and new mechanisms for their inclusion into our markets and economies are under rapid development such as carbon trading and payment for ecosystem services. There is a need to reduce transaction costs and increase the scale of PES schemes. Of the many biomes and ecosystems that make up the living Earth, forests and oceans are undergoing rapid change, representing places where biodiversity and ecosystem services need urgent and special attention. Thus FOBES, though its domain encompasses all of life on Earth, emphasizes forest and ocean biodiversity and ecosystem functions when considering solutions for achieving sustainable development and environmental sustainability. The Work Ahead The FOBES Thematic Group aims to support the design and implementation of the sustainable development goals underlying key environmental conventions that address the global environmental commons. These include the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), to name just a few biodiversity-related agreements. Also, the FOBES Thematic Group will liaise with existing international research programs, such as DIVERSITAS, the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), the International Council for Science - Future Earth (ICSU-FutureEarth), and the major global environmental assessments, such as, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the World Ocean assessment.    5  Forests, Oceans, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.  Illustrated is the diversity of life as an evolutionary tree that underlies the  functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide.  Only three biomes are illustrated  forests being converted to  agriculture, oceans whose resources are being unsustainably harvested, and in the center, grasslands being converted to  grazinglands and pastures.   Earths biogeochemistry, which governs climate, atmospheric composition, soil fertility, ocean  productivity, and much more, is illustrated by elemental and nutrient cycling in the topmost layer.  This is the domain of FOBES.   175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214   Introduction The Living World Environmental sustainability on a rich and varied planet Nature is complex, diverse, and highly dynamic and as much a source of our prosperity as it is a challenge to achieving a more equitable and sustainable world. Across the vast reaches of our planet, no matter the scale, whether from households to the biosphere, people, plants, animals, and the nearly invisible but ubiquitous microorganisms, collectively produce a global environment that sustains all of life on Earth. In any given place at any given time, life may be doing a poor job of insuring environmental sustainability, creating conditions in which species perish, energy and nutrients fail to cycle efficiently, and ecosystems become fragile and incapable of tolerating environmental shocks. In other places, however, ecological systems flourish; they are productive and robust.  Figure 1.  A rich and varied planet.

As we move from the poles to the equator, we encounter tundra, boreal forests, temperate forests, grasslands, deserts, and rainforests. As we move from east to west there are arid regions in the rain shadows of mountains, lakes, ponds, rivers, wetlands, and bogs, and when we reach the seas we encounter kelp forests and sea grass beds, coral reefs, the pelagic communities of the open sea, and dark yet biologically diverse abyssal plains of the oceans floors. We also encounter relatively young human-dominated ecosystems such as farms, forest plantations, grazing lands, pastures, urban and suburban systems, coastal harbors, fish farms, aquaculture production systems and, in the oceans, vast fleets of fishing vessels harvesting seafood from virtually every marine habitat. Although our living world is vast, varied, and seemingly incomprehensibly intricate, the key to the environmental equitability and sustainability we seek is fairly basic  the sum of ecosystems that function productively, efficiently, and robustly must equal or exceed the sum of those that do not. That is, over time, negative outcomes of unsustainable management and environmental degradation must be countered by the positive influences of sustainable management and restoration. While this truism is simple in principle, in actuality, perhaps the single most challenging scientific issue facing humanity is understanding how ten million species scattered over one-hundred and fifty million square kilometers of land and suffused through 1.4 billion   6   215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  So long as the extent of productive,  efficient, and robust ecosystems  cubic kilometers of water that covers three-hundred and sixty million square kilometers, or 70% of Earths surface, with a total mass of living organisms weighing in at one trillion tons (just in carbon, and half of this mass consisting of microorganisms), manages, as a whole, to function productively and efficiently over the long term. Over the short term, the extent of productive and efficient ecosystems may or may not exceed the extent of those that are not, but over the long term, the net result is usually positive and Earths ecosystems have collectively sustained life for billions of years. So long as the extent of productive, efficient, and robust ecosystems exceeds the extent of unproductive, inefficient, and fragile ecosystems, Earth can continue to sustain an equitable environment, support life and remain within safe planetary boundaries (see Fig. 2, below). exceeds the extent of unproductive,  inefficient, and fragile ecosystems,  Earth can continue to sustain an  equitable environment and remain  within safe planetary boundaries.  New beginnings, new commitments Since the Holocene, a rather quiet and stable climatic epoch that started some twelve thousand years ago, Earth has changed dramatically in the last several decades. Human influences over biodiversity and ecosystem processes have led to a distinct epoch in Earths history, so much so that some now refer to our current times as the Anthropocene. The earth as influenced by human activities is characterized by anomalously high rates of extinction, emerging diseases, biotic exchange (the spread of exotic and invasive species), increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, global warming, ocean acidification and dramatic alterations of Earths hydrological, and elemental cycles, not just biologically important elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur, but fluxes of over sixty elements, including toxic elements like mercury, uranium and lead, now exceed natural fluxes because of human activities that include mining, construction, industry, farming, and much more . Humans now also dominate geological processes, moving more earth than occurs naturally . And all this has happened only in a fraction of the time of the evolutionary process since the Holocene, actually only in the last part of the XVIII century. All these changes are attributable to human activities, most of which have been directed to improve human wellbeing. In some cases, humans have managed ecosystems sustainably, but since the Industrial Revolution, or the 1700s, economic development has consisted of deforestation exceeding reforestation, unsustainable extraction of marine biological resources to the point of several major fisheries are collapsing or on the verge of collapsing, and many sources of unregulated pollution. Taking a business-as-usual approach is not tenable because if we continue to change the earth ecosystems are likely to suddenly collapse and Earth itself could cross safe planetary boundaries (Fig. 2). Fortunately, humanity is working to follow new pathways in this early part of the Anthropocene. Commitments to following more sustainable pathways to reduce the adverse environmental conditions we face today are many. Following the United Nations (UN) Brundtland report, Our Common Future, published in 1987, Earth Summits in 1992, 2002, and 2012, the Millennium   7  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297   Development Goals (MDGs, 2000-2015), and now proposals for the next generation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015-2030), nations around the world have committed to following alternative pathways of development, ones that will ultimately lead to environmental sustainability. Biodiversity features prominently in such commitments and the Convention on Biological Diversitys 2020 targets , Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services , MDG 7 to Ensure Environmental Sustainability , and the proposed SDG 9 to Secure Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity and Ensure good Management of Water and Other Natural Resources , all demonstrate broad recognition of the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems for improving human wellbeing.  Developments scorecard Historically, development was not always guided by a framework of sustainability. Until today much of human progress is attributable to unsustainable use of resources, over exploitation of the ecosystems. As a consequence biodiversity was reduced and the services that ecosystems are providing become increasingly under pressure.. Initially, because the supply far exceeded the demand when populations were small, this development pathway worked well. That we have reached seven billion people is testament to the extraordinary success of humanity during the course of what has proven ultimately to be unsustainable development. The score card for humanitys success, however, is extraordinarily uneven. Advances in science, technology, and engineering have accelerated the acquisition and sharing of knowledge, including access to remote natural resources. Maternal and infant health has seen marked increases, and food production and food security has increased steadily. A billion people, however, remain hungry today, two billion are below the poverty line, and three billion are without sufficient access to water and a number of social essentials such as education, health care, gender equity, and security remain out of reach for the poor and vulnerable. Figure 2.  Biodiversity and ecosystems  a safe planetary boundary  already crossed?  Rockstrm  and colleagues described levels of global  environmental conditions that within which Earth would probably  function in a way that would sustain life.  Of these, current levels of  biodiversity loss was  deemed dangerously high, or well above levels of  loss that could be tolerated without jeopardizing robust functioning of  Earths many life-support systems, including global climate.  Green  regions represent safe planetary boundaries.  Red indicates current  values.  Safe planetary boundaries have been crossed for seven of the  nine illustrated in the figure.  (Modified from the original paper.)   The world has committed itself to improving its scorecard, as evidenced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, 2000-2015) and now in the soon to be launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015-2030).   8  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318  319  320  321  322  323  324  325  326  327  328  329  330  331   We will need to have sustainable development strategies in place, the collective will to stay the course, and a global commitment to biodiversity and ecological preservation. Also, it will be crucial to ensure wise management of all ecosystems, especially forest and marine ecosystems, for the developments scorecard in 2030 to show higher marks than it does today. A fundamental framework for the 21st Century Ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, and tundra on land or kelp forests, coral reefs, pelagic and abyssal plains in oceans, constitute the natural foundation for human wellbeing. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a five-year analysis by over 1300 social and natural scientists, developed an elegant framework for understanding how our wellbeing is linked to nature. Put simply: Biodiversity  Ecosystem Function  Ecosystem Services  Human Wellbeing. This four-part framework, illustrated in Figure 3, captures the essential principles that govern our prosperity. Biodiversity, or the ecological, functional, and genetic diversity of plants, animals, and microorganisms, are what make an ecosystem function. Twenty years of research has confirmed that the greater the diversity of life, the greater the magnitude and stability of ecosystem functions such as the production of biomass, the cycling of key nutrients, and the production and sequestration of greenhouse gasses. A very simplistic global level this means, that the performance of ecosystems is enhanced by having high biodiversity and diminished when biodiversity is reduced. This perspective is simply a framework of analysis, and the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services is far more nuanced than a linear function. More research will need to be conducted to fully understand these complex relations. For example, biodiversity here is being considered as the diversity of species in the broadest sense of the term, would also consider the diversity of biomes and the extent and distribution of unconverted habitats. Also, while some fundamental processes of ecosystem functions, such as food production, increases in systems of lower diversity, this is not true for all ecosystem functions and certainly not for all ecosystem services. Among ecosystem functions, some clearly benefit humans in important ways, such as food production, watershed outflow, soil production, erosion control, crop pollination, the regulation of pests and pestilence, and climate regulation. Without the reliable provisioning of such ecosystem services, human wellbeing is jeopardized  not just the obvious dimensions of human wellbeing, such as having enough food and water, but all dimensions that ultimately rest on environmental sustainability and security.   9   Spatial and temporal variability  define our planet and is the source of  much of human cultural diversity as  It is the source of much of biological  diversity at all scales.    Figure 3.  The modern framework for human wellbeing.  (Source, Global Environmental Outlook 5, UNEP)   Ecosystems: Earths environmental engines Life is everywhere Spatial and temporal variability define our planet and are the source of much of human cultural diversity, sometimes called biocultural diversity, and biological diversity at all scales. Temperature and photoperiod vary annually with latitude. Light under water diminishes dramatically as one moves from shallow coastal shelves to deeper waters. On land, topographic features create deserts in the rain shadows of mountains and alpine conditions as one moves up in elevation. Surface water salinity varies as one moves inland from the coast along mangrove forests and salt marshes. These environmental gradients create myriad conditions that have resulted in millions of different kinds of species that vary enormously in their size, shape, physiology, and other traits  some land plants can tolerate salt, drought, and fire while others can live in perennially wet, dark and cold cloud forests. Some fish, like snail fish, live almost eight kilometers below the sea while a small plane collided with a vulture in 1973 above the Ivory Coast, West Africa, eleven kilometers above sea level. The masters of living everywhere, in even the most extreme environments, are the microorganisms, some of which live in crusts of hydrothermal vents beneath the sea, some in crusts atop desert sands.   10  332  333  334  335  336  337  338  339  340  341  342  343  344  345  346  347  348  349    Figure 3.  Biomes, ecosystems, biodiversity and carbon.  Biomes are climatically defined regions with characteristic vegetation and often  characteristic animal diversity.  This figure illustrates the mass of life as measured by carbon content, and how it is distributed on Earth.   Note how life is found virtually everywhere in spite of incredible variability in surface conditions (e.g., icy poles to a warm equator).   Ocean biodiversity is not illustrated, but is of greater mass that is especially concentrated on continental shelves.   (From:  http://www.carbon-biodiversity.net/Issues/CarbonStorage)  Earths diversity in environmental conditions contributes not just to biological diversity, but also to human cultural diversity. Not surprisingly, cultural diversity, such as our great lingual, culinary, and artistic diversity, often correlates biological diversity. In the same way that biodiversity is found in every habitat, humans are found in most every terrestrial ecosystem, from the Arctic to the Namibian desert, and although humans do not live yet in oceans, our massive impacts on marine resources inextricably links us to virtually all marine ecosystems. In fact, oceans are critical for our survival as they control the hydrological cycle (including distribution of rain on land) and its wast life in the oceans that created oxygen in the atmosphere upon which we are dependent. In addition, the ocean has taken up between a third and one half of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted to the atmosphere and, in this manner, impact radiative forcing and ameliorate climate change. Biodiversity and environment: a two-way interaction Physical environmental conditions play dominant roles in governing where biodiversity and ecosystems are found, but biodiversity and ecosystems also modify physical environmental conditions  its a two way interaction. Earths climate is a result of solar, orbital, and planetary factors, but it is also the result of many geochemical processes that are strongly modified by biological processes, or biogeochemical processes. Nitrogen cycling, for example, the dominant gas in our atmosphere and a key element in soil fertility, is almost entirely driven by microbial processes and microbial communities. Similarly, terrestrial and marine ecosystems each contribute roughly equally to carbon cycling that influences how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses are in our atmosphere which strongly influences warming and global climate and oceans have absorbed nearly half the anthropogenic carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution. Another example of the complexity is an influence of marine life on 350  351  352  353  354  355  356  357  358  359  360  361  362  363  364  365  366  367  368  369  370  371  372  373    11  374  375  376  377  378  379  380  381  382  383  384  385  386  387  388  389  390  391  392  393  394   precipitation. Through a complex web of biological processes, oceanic organisms produce dimethyl sulfide (a compound that often gives sea air its characteristic odor) that is a key atmospheric aerosol which forms nuclei around which water vapor condensates, forms droplets, and eventually forms clouds that affect regional radiation and precipitation. Though the biological and physical worlds are inextricably bound to one another, where any major change in one will lead to a major change in the other, the processes involved are largely invisible. Without instrumentation, one never sees the fluxing of greenhouse gases, the cycling of nutrients, or the millions of tons of microorganisms that make up the living world. To the untrained eye, many plants look alike so their diversity is not readily apparent. Most animals are small, inconspicuous, or simply live in places we are unlikely to see them, such as life under the sea, in the soils, or in the canopies of forests. We see the living world around us, but not its diversity and not how it influences our environment. Much of lifes diversity and lifes processes may be invisible but without them our world would be incapable of sustaining life  it takes life to sustain life. Perhaps the easiest way to see how dramatically biodiversity affects our environment is to compare our planet to its lifeless neighbors, Mars and Venus (Fig. 4). Take away photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas regulation, the production of biomass, and much more, and oxygen vanishes, greenhouse gasses dominate the atmosphere, temperatures soar, and the planet becomes uninhabitable. When we consider safe planetary boundaries it is not surprising that biodiversity loss is the most worrisome of all the boundaries we have crossed (Fig. 2).   12    Figure 4.  It is easy to see the two-way interaction between life and our environment when we compare our home to our  neighboring planets.  Physical and chemical models of Earth suggest that if we were to remove all of life from our planet it  would eventually reach a chemical and physical equilibrium in which we looked like other rocky planets in our solar  system.  Most likely, Earth without life would have environmental conditions somewhere between Venus (left) and Mars  (right)  completely incapable of sustaining life.  At a planetary scale, the lifeless hostile abodes of Mars and Venus show clearly the value of blue planet. On Earth the co-existence of an atmosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere have allowed ecosystems to develop, which today provide all the essential life supporting services the to human race. At local scales, however, bleached coral reefs covered in algae and devoid of fish, dust storms over deserts created by overgrazing, and landslides that often follow deforestation provide references for what happens when ecosystems are over exploited and biodiversity reduced. Keeping ecosystems from further degradation to barrens and wastelands, unproductive oceans and toxic waste sites require different strategies, policies, goals, targets, indicators and solutions. But the importance of resilient ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity remains the same across all scales. A species-rich planet is a healthier more resilient planet and a species rich ecosystem, whether it is a farm, city, forest or ocean, is typically healthier and more resilient. Dominant ecosystems in the pathway to sustainable development Forests Among terrestrial ecosystems, our thematic group will pay special attention to forests. As one of the worlds richest repositories of biodiversity , a key source of ecosystem services for many nations, and undergoing rapid change, emphasis on forests in sustainable development is important. The sustaining services that forests provide are critical to Earths climate. Forests strongly influence Earths hydrological cycles through the evapotranspiration of water through trees and regulation of water sheds. Their influence in carbon cycling is also well documented , both of which are key elements in Earths climate system. The extent of forests is diminishing, which means that their ability to function and provide important ecosystem services will be compromised. In most cases, forest loss is attributable to agricultural expansion, not just logging. On current trends, agricultural expansion will reduce forest cover by 1.3% per year until 2030, a trend that is exacerbated by dietary shifts towards greater consumption of livestock, livestock products, and vegetable oils as nations develop. The Amazon forest, for example, could decrease by 40% by 2050 at current rates of agricultural expansion driven by growth in soybean and cattle production. The story is similar for Asia, especially in the face of oil palm expansion and Africa which is also losing forest to rising demands for timber and agricultural expansion. 395  396  397  398  399  400  401  402  403  404  405  406  407  408  409  410  411  412  413  414  415  416  417  418  419  420  421  422  423  424  425    13   426  427  428  429  430  431  432  433  434  435  436  437  438  439  440  441  442  443  444  445  446  447  448  449  450  451  452  453  454  455  456  457  458  459  460  Oceans Oceans are the primary regulator of the global climate and an important sink for greenhouse gases. They provide us with water and the oxygen we breathe. Oceans and the many marine ecosystems are so vast, that there was a sense that they are immune to the actions of humans. However, in many ways, oceans are changing faster and more dramatically than their terrestrial partners. For example, over 90% of the extra heat energy now stored near the Earth's surface as a result of the changing concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contained in the ocean. The ocean has taken up between a third and one half of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted to the atmosphere. The dissolved carbon dioxide has lowed the oceans pH, a process described at ocean acidification. Overall, Halpern estimated in 2008 that roughly 40% of the global ocean is heavily affected by human activities. Some estimates place 80% of our global biomass in the oceans and this mass accounts for half of global photosynthesis and respiration, the processes that drive most ecosystem functions. Massive though this is, major changes are in store. In the face of anthropogenic climate change, for example, most models predict contraction of the productive sea ice biome and expansion of the less productive sub-tropical gyre biome. On a global level, a decrease in primary production1 (Zhao and Running (2010), fish biomass2 (Ransom and Worm 2003) and whale abundance (IWC 2013) 3has already been observed. Oceans are more than just fish stocks, but fish represent a key connection between humanity and the oceans. Fish are important sources of protein for over 1.5 billion people and fisheries and aquaculture employ nearly 200 million people. Although expert calculations of the degree of overfishing vary, official FAO estimates show that roughly one quarter of all stocks are overfished. About half of all stocks are fished with yields reaching their maximum capacity, which without other stresses would be sustainable. However, reliable numbers on the state of stocks are only available for roughly 500 of 1,500 stocks currently fished upon. Oceans are also source of materials for many industries and transport across oceans is the most common, cost-effective means of global trade. Oceans are key sources of minerals and fossil fuels that we will in the near future exploit increasingly as technology for mining and extraction in marine habitats improves and Arctic sea ice retreats. Impacts on our oceans are not just from such extractive industries but also marine traffic that accounts for over 90% of global trade, currently conducted by over sixty-three thousand vessels. Marine pollution from land-based sources is also widespread and increasing at rapid rates. Sources and types of marine pollution vary from heavy metals and radioactive material to plastic. Nutrient runoff and untreated sewage that can lead to eutrophication and well known dead zones and harmful algal blooms (HAB). Some of the worst regions being Western                                                              1 Zhao, Maosheng, and Steven W.

Hypoxia and HAB deteriorate the quality of water and can change or reduce species diversity or cause the deaths of fish, birds and marine mammals when toxins are produced. On top of natural resource extraction, marine traffic, and pollution, climate change is taking its toll and likely to irrevocably alter ocean biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is leading to increased uptake of CO2 by the ocean leading to ocean acidification. Ocean surface pH has already lowered (e.g., become more acidic) by 0.1 pH compared to pre-industrial values and is expected to further decrease by an additional 0.3-0.4 units by 2100, which would be the lowest value registered in the last 23 million years. The impacts of ocean acidification are still under investigation, but it clearly poses a threat to the abundance, health, physiology, and biogeochemistry of several key marine species and their food webs. Prominent examples are: coral reefs, shellfish and calcareous plankton, the base of much of the marine food chain. Some predictions say, that if current CO2 emission rates continue unabated then there will be no regions in the world's ocean AT ALL where conditions are predicted to be able to support the net growth of coral skeletons by the mid 2060s. Coral reef degradation, especially when degradation leads to loss of reef mass, would reduce protection for shorelines from erosion and flooding and impact local fisheries, tourism and recreation industries, as well as related maritime economies. Currently, it is not certain whether marine species and ecosystems will be able to adapt to changes in ocean chemistry, but due to the fact that pH values have dropped remarkably in the last century there is great concern about ocean acidification threats that could alter marine food webs, which could have far- reaching consequences for the oceans and millions of people depending on them for food resources. Global warming can lead to stratification and the formation of anaerobic conditions where seawater contains virtually no oxygen and most living organisms perish . In summary, though people do not actually live in the ocean, atmosphere, land and ocean are so tightly coupled that environmental sustainability is not achievable unless marine conservation and stewardship are integral parts of sustainable development pathways. FOBES Sustainable Development Solutions Initiating the Process Central to identifying solutions to the challenges of transitioning from traditional development to sustainable development through the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services is providing a single guiding framework. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), for example, developed its guiding, overarching framework as its first step. Securing biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides requires an integrative social- natural science framework. This framework would identify major classes of ecosystem services, key classes of social and natural drivers of change, and quantifiable linkages among them. These drivers and linkages represent the foci for the development of coupled social/natural models, quantitative metrics, and policy relevant indicators that will be necessary for the development and implementation of solutions for achieving sustainable development.   15   501  502  503  504  505  506  507  508  509  510  511  512  513  514  515  516  517  518  519  This integrative social-natural science framework, illustrated in Figure 5, considers all ecosystems residing on a scale that spans natural (unmanaged) systems at one end and managed (e.g., agro-ecosystems, pastures, rangelands, agroforestry, urban areas) on the other. Unmanaged and managed ecosystems therefore represent endpoints of a continuum and no ecosystem is likely to represent either extreme. All ecosystems are either directly managed by humans, whether they are marine protected areas or wildlife reserves. Likewise, all managed systems have some components, most often microbial communities and invertebrates, that are not directly managed but which still respond indirectly to human management. In the FOBES framework, unmanaged systems are shown as those primarily providing regulating (e.g., pollination, soil stabilization and resilience against natural disasters), cultural (e.g., recreational and inspirational values), and supporting services (e.g., nutrient cycling and soil production) and are the principle repositories for Earths biodiversity, but they provide insufficient food, fiber, or fuel (provisioning services). In contrast, managed systems primarily provide provisioning services, but at a cost to biodiversity and other services. Note that implicit in this framework is the integration of ecological knowledge/methods in practices such as agriculture, pastoralism, and forestry in the social/natural component. Figure 5.  Ecosystem transitions between natural and managed systems.  FOBESs framework, adapted from Naeem et al. (2009) and   congruent with Clark and Levin (2009), considers ecosystems ranging from managed to unmanaged, though in reality no ecosystem is  independent of human influence.  Two ecosystems are illustrated; unmanaged on the right and, after human induced transitions, managed  on the left.  The double arrow indicates that ecosystems can exist anywhere along a gradient of management and can move in either  direction depending on human decisions and actions.   Note that the quantity of different ecosystem services and biodiversity change  along the management gradient, but remain connected to global circulations and  global trade, transportation, and travel.   16  520  521    522  523  524  525  526  527  528  529  530  531  532  533  534  535  536  537  538  539  540  541  542  543  544  545  546  547  548  549  550  551  552  553  554  555  556  557  558  559  560  561  562  In the FOBES framework (Fig. 5), social/natural factors and drivers divide into three categories: (1) social/cultural such as economic, political, and behavioral, such as shifting diets to more or less meat; (2) agricultural/forestry such as yield gaps, irrigation, and cropping efficiencies, plantation forests, natural forest management; and (3) natural such as biodiversity, climate, and nutrient cycling and extreme weather events. Although the relative magnitude and stability of services provided by ecosystems vary, all ecosystems supply the same complement of services, but managed systems often optimize provisioning services at the cost of supporting, regulating, and cultural services. In that sense, it would be useful to systematize and disseminate the sustainable ways to produce services. It is crucial to stress that both the framework and the solutions we propose are to initiate the process. FOBES members will work precisely on developing its framework and solutions in collaboration with other Thematic Groups. Also, the FOBES framework will inspire itself on the exiting work, such as the conceptual framework for IPBES From a conceptual point of view, managed ecosystems need to be improved so as to increase their regulation services. There are many cases of agricultural practices that can lead to increased soil carbon socks, such as low tillage agriculture that also reduces erosion and protects watersheds. Unmanaged ecosystems need to have their regulating and cultural services valued economically, like areas protected by indigenous communities for spiritual or cultural reasons. For example, the value of these services produced by protected areas should be recognized and result in better public and private funding for their protection. FOBES Areas of action and recommendations Action area 1. Reduce agricultural expansion by improving efficiency More efficient agro-ecosystems that require less external inputs (e.g., biocides, water and fertilizers) can substantially reduce agricultural expansion at the expense of natural forest and savannas. In developing countries, where agriculture is dominated by smallholder farming, emphasis should be placed on bolstering bottom-up solutions such as providing improved technical assistance, improved access to credit, payments for avoided deforestation and ecosystem services, traditional conservation-friendly farming practices, farmer cooperatives and more consistent environmental law enforcement. In developed countries, where agriculture is dominated by carbon-intensive production systems, emphasis should be given to technological solutions that reduce input demand and revert perverse government incentives and subsidies, as well as domestic and international consumer pressures against unsustainable agricultural products, and innovative tax policies. Also, nutrient burdens from agricultural run-off (fertilizer, manure), has led to continued growth in the occurrence of coastal hypoxic zones and economic damages approaching USD 100   17   563  564  565  566  567  568  569  570  571  572  573  574  575  576  577  578  579  580  581  582  583  584  585  586  587  588  589  590  591  592  593  594  595  596  597  598  599  600  601  602  billion per year in the EU alone. The need to begin a transition to much more cyclic management of nutrients whereby efficiency of fertilizer use is increased and the majority of human and livestock waste nutrients are recovered and reused for fertilizer and other needs. In parallel, some analyses project that available phosphorus reserves could run out as early as this century with unprecedented effects on global food security; whether it is this soon or somewhat longer doesnt negate the fact that eventually, phosphorus recovery from the waste stream will need to become the norm, not the exception if long-term global food security is to be ensured. (UN Blueprint on ocean and coastal sustainability, 2011) North-south technology transfers have often resulted in problems for tropical agriculture. South- south technology exchanges should be greatly encouraged. A success story of how research can help increase agricultural productivity is the case of Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). Embrapa is a governmental research institution, focused on technology development that has played a key role in increasing the productivity of many agricultural products in Brazil through the development and spread of new products and technologies. For example, the area designated for the production of grains and vegetable oil seeds in Brazil increased in 44% while production increased in 250% and incomes increased 2.4 times. Action area 2. Decoupling economic development from deforestation One of the most important challenges of sustainable development is to decouple economic development from deforestation. This is particularly important for countries in which agriculture plays an important role in the economy. A noteworthy example is Brazil, a country with the largest area of tropical forest in the world and in which agriculture plays an important role in the national economy. In 2011, the agribusiness sector (agriculture and cattle ranching) in Brazil represented 22.15% of the countrys GDP. Brazil has reduced Amazonian deforestation by over 75% between 2004 and 2011, while increasing its GDP (Fig. 6). Since 2011, in the State of Par, in the Brazilian Amazon, municipalities have also started to implement policies to reduce deforestation through a program called green municipalities which emphasizes integrating land tenure and environmental planning, shared environmental management, and supporting sustainable production to meet ambitious but realistic targets. Policies to reduce deforestation should consider five important elements (1) the establishment of protected areas in collaboration with local and indigenous communities, (2) conventional command and control (fines, apprehension of illegal goods and products such as wood), (3) financial and commercial disincentives for those who deforest illegally, (4) economic incentives to sustainable forest economies, (5) and financial incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation through payment for ecosystem services. However, such initiatives should separate their focus on industrial and corporate groups from poor smallholders, in terms of the management approaches used as well as the financial incentive and disincentive structures employed. There is a need to have a poverty focus as a way to link these activities with the   18  603  604  605  606  607  608  609  610  611  612  613  614  615  616  617  618  619  620  621  622  623  624  625   boarder goal of reducing social inequity. Once again, the Amazon serves as an example, such as the Bolsa Floresta Program that incorporated these five elements. Additionally, international support, such as Norways donations to the Amazon Fund, can facilitate such programs by adding incentives that reduce deforestation, and participation by civil society also played an important role by running highly visible campaigns that applied political pressure on governments and businesses to support sustainability. These activities led to a soybean moratorium  a commitment signed by large companies not to buy from soybean producers who engaged in deforestation in the Amazon. Reduction of deforestation can also be reached with good forest management. A good example is the one of the Community Concessions in Petn, Guatemala. In the dry season the fires occur in the Core Zone and the Buffer Zone of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve, while the Multiple Use Zone, in which certified forest management occurs, almost no fires happen because the forest have a value for the communities and they protect it.  Figure 6. Annual deforestation rate in the Amazon and growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in  Brazil between 1989 and 2011.  Indonesia is another noteworthy case - a country with the third largest area of tropical forests (after Brazil and Democratic Republic of Congo). Agriculture, like in many other tropical nations, is an important source of revenue in Indonesia representing 15% of the countrys GDP. Palm oil, in particular, represents 6 to 7% of the Indonesian GDP, while forestry (harvesting and silviculture) contributes approximately 1% . Indonesia has recently implemented a new set of policies aimed at reducing deforestation and degradation as a part of a national REDD+ strategy. This includes: (i) a moratorium on new concessions, which suspends the granting of new concession licenses for logging and conversion of forests and peat lands, signed in mid-   19   626  627  628  629  630  631  632  633  634  635  636  637  638  639  640  641  642  643  644  645  646  647  648  649  650  651  652  653  654  655  656  657  658  659  660  661  662  663  664  665  666  2011, and protects 43.3 million hectares, avoiding the emission of estimated 92.8 giga-tons of CO2e to the atmosphere; (ii) the establishment of national emissions reduction target of 26 to 41% ; (iii) the establishment of a national REDD+ strategy, which is one of the outputs foreseen by the REDD+ Task Force, created by a Presidential Decree in 2010, to prepare the countrys REDD+ infrastructure ; and (iv) a landmark policy to recognize indigenous peoples rights over forests . Action area 3. Develop economic instruments for ecosystem services Valuing nature has both supporters and detractors but, in many, cases governmental and non- governmental institutions, land owners, managers, urban planners, and most stakeholders require ways in which ecosystem services can be understood in economic terms. Ecosystem services (sometimes referred to as environmental or natures services) are difficult to value, but tremendous progress has been made. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative, for example, has drawn considerable attention to the economic benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. TEEB has developed clear, concise, and consistent approaches for assessing and incorporating the values of biodiversity and ecosystem services into decision- making often through incentives and price signals. TEEB emphasizes the importance of both benefits and costs of economic development which too often focuses solely on benefits without accounting for societal costs. The economic benefits of agricultural expansion, for example, are often not weighed against the benefits derived from sustainable forestry in terms of timber and non-timber forest products such as fruits and fiber. Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs are among the most rapidly growing mechanisms for enabling ecosystem service markets. PES programs can be devised to insure that both buyers and sellers can participate in the trade of ecosystem goods and services. PES is especially important for biodiversity conservation which is traditionally done by governments and NGOs, but most (90%) of the land where biodiversity resides is outside of such protection . By one estimate, PES programs for biodiversity could benefit 10  15 million low-income households in developing countries, PES for carbon could benefit an additional 25-50 million households, PES for watershed protection benefit another 80  100 million, and PES for cultural ecosystem services benefit yet another 8 - 10 million households. Costa Rica, for example, in 1996 implemented a 3.5% tax on fossil fuels to balance the benefits of industrial development with the costs of degradation of ecosystem services and created the Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Florestal (FONAFIFO) to provide financial support to forest owners and indigenous peoples to conserve and sustainably manage forested areas, or to reforest degraded land. Since its creation, with an annual budget currently between US$14 -17 million/year, which corresponds to around 0.04% of the countrys GDP, the program has resulted in nearly 13,000 contracts, covered nearly 800,000 hectares of forests and distributed almost US$280 million. Still, in Costa Rica, PES is considered only one of the many policy mechanisms and instruments of sustainable development available. In addition to this, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an important component of a sustainability strategy to deal with food production and forest protection. CSA is a concept based in three   20   667  668  669  670  671  672  673  674  675  676  677  678  679  680  681  682  683  684  685  686  687  688  689  690  691  692  693  694  695  696  697  698  699  700  701  702  703  704  705  pillars: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, adaptation and building resilience to climate change, and reducing and/or removing GHG emissions. CSA is an important mechanism to increase efficiency in food production, tackling food security, reducing ecological footprint and adapting to climate change scenarios. CATIE is developing a wider concept, named as Climate Smart Territories, because the territorial approach follows better the path of the Adaptive Mosaic of the Millennium Ecosystems Assessment. In a same territory several realities coexist in time: agriculture, cattle farming, cities, forests, and it is necessary to take actions regarding all land uses, no only in agriculture. The World Economic Forum estimates that agriculture is responsible for 30% of GHG emissions, forestry is responsible for 16% GHG, and agriculture is responsible for 40% of worldwide employment. When climate varies, crop losses can be enormous and in some regions, such as the Sahelian countries, crop losses can range from 30% to 100% in the face of drought. These estimates vary according to different sources, but the general split is consistent in the various reports. Agriculture also consumes 70% of the fresh water we mobilize from natural sources. Better management systems and technology use could dramatically improve food provisioning from agro-ecosystems while not jeopardizing services provided by unmanaged ecosystems by minimizing or eliminating agricultural expansion. Following the 2010 Water Footprint Networks report, agriculture consumes 2.6m3 of water for 1 ton of cereal (2005). The target is to reduce this by half (1.5m3/ton of cereal) by 2030. This can be accomplished basically by implementing three integrated actions: (i) improving the diversity of crops by agro-ecological systems, (ii) providing capacity building for such small and medium farmers, and (iii) fostering credit and other incentives for this transition. Financial and non-financial incentives are needed for climate smart agriculture. Therefore, policy frameworks are much needed  especially in least developed countries, where agriculture plays an important role within national GDP. These frameworks are essential to reduce the ecological footprint, reduce pressure on forests and help meet growing demands for food production. However, the effect of ecosystem services on human wellbeing cannot be quantified through purely economic approaches alone, although these form an important component of solutions- focused planning. Thus it is important to supplement the use of economic valuation and economic instruments with a focus on cultural and social ecosystem services, which are often much more locally variable, and socially stratified within locations, thus difficult to quantify. A focus on quantification should not obscure the importance of such cultural and social ecosystem services for human wellbeing, especially but not exclusively for disadvantaged communities such as indigenous groups, women and the poor. Action area 4. Emphasize the participatory process People play important roles as providers of ecosystem services, but their roles are often neglected in sustainable development. Indigenous and traditional populations have some of the   21  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  714  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  740  741  742  743  744  745   worst health and education indicators and stand to benefit the most from achieving sustainable development. Indigenous knowledge, though limited in some regards, reflects knowledge accumulated over long periods, passed from one generation to the next, and reflects knowledge on time scales that better reflect ecological time scales rather than timescales of typical Western research (2-5 years) for terrestrial, freshwater, marine ecosystems. Examples of inclusion of indigenous people in ecosystem service sustainable development programs are the vanguard proposition of Coordination of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon (COICA )  an umbrella organization for all indigenous peoples of the nine countries of the Amazonian ecosystem. COICA has formulated the REDD+ Indigena  their own version of how a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mechanism should work. In contrast to REDD+, the REDD Indigenas strategy is to contribute to global strategies for mitigation in adaptation in a way that strengthens ecosystem functions on earth through the holistic management of indigenous territories. It aims to establish a full life plan for the long term, guarantee the tenure rights of indigenous people, promote a holistic management that integrates mitigation and adaptation to climate change, sustainably manage biodiversity, provide financial compensations based on public funds, and ensure social control over development by directly addressing the drivers of deforestation such as oil, mining, timber harvesting, and other extractive industries as well as agricultural expansion. Indigenous populations inhabit most remaining tropical forests, thus it is important to recognize the rights of these people to resources in their homelands. Countries such Colombia, Equator, and Brazil have gone a long way in recognizing these rights and progress is being made in countries such as Indonesia, where the rights of indigenous peoples to forest resources have recently been legally established. There are still vast forest areas where unclear forest tenure leads to social conflicts, crime and extreme poverty. A successful approach to ensure appropriate participation of local people is through adaptative management approach at the territorial level. A noteworthy case is the Iberoamerican Model Forests Newtwork, that includes 29 territories in 15 countries with more than 32 million ha. This is part of an international effort of a bottom-up process to get the sustainable human development of forest rich territories, currently led by CATIE. Action area 5. Expand biodiversity and ecosystem function/service research Funding for biodiversity research is frequently among the smallest portion of research and development budgets. Most countries have departments or ministries for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, or the environment, but allocation of resources to biodiversity and ecosystem service research is negligible. Even in the United States, for example, where annual federal spending on research and development is $65 billion, less than 1% is invested in biodiversity research. Nations with smaller budgets for research and development spend even less. This low allocation stems largely from a historical and traditional perspective in which biodiversity is seen primarily as an abstract topic with little application in comparison to biology, chemistry, or   22  746  747  748  749  750  751  752  753  754  755  756  757  758  759  760  761  762  763  764  765  766  767  768  769  770  771  772  773  774  775  776  777  778  779  780  781  782  783  784  785   physics where links to medicine and engineering are well accepted. Biodiversitys link to human wellbeing, economic development, and environmental sustainability are now well understood and research in biodiversity and ecosystem service research needs to expand to become comparable to other investments in scientific research. While the acceleration of research on all ecosystems would provide immense benefits for people, forests and marine ecosystems should take priority. Three basic investments in biodiversity research will have enormous benefits compared to costs. These are: 1. Complete the inventory of every nations plant, animal, and microbial diversity across three dimensions of biodiversity  taxonomic (e.g., the number of species), functional (e.g., the diversity of traits such as body size, metabolic rates, and nutrient and water use efficiency), and phylogenetic (e.g., evolutionary). Such inventories are critical starting points for developing strategies and policies for achieving environmental sustainability through natural resource conservation and management. Such inventories will, of course, miss the important point species presence does not guarantee that they are functioning in ecosystems, providing services or likely to persist if their numbers are low. Wherever possible, estimates of abundance are important. 2. Conduct global and national assessments and inventories of ecosystem services. Such information is necessary for economic valuation and for understanding the true economic impact of development across all scales. Development strategies, for example, that invest in one ecosystem service (e.g., agriculture focuses on provisioning services, ecotourism focuses on cultural services) will invariably lead to losses in other services, but assessments and inventories can be used to prevent such outcomes. The challenge faced will be to sustain observations and build capacities in those countries that need it. This might be particularly difficult with maritime nations where ocean research is costly. 3. Increase education and training in basic, applied, and integrative (where basic is linked to applied issues) biodiversity research, including the links of biodiversity with social sciences. By making basic and applied biodiversity science part of grade-school educational curricula, by ensuring that universities have programs in biodiversity research, and by creating, investing in or incentivizing individuals to make biodiversity part of their career development, we can help to create the new environmental workforce necessary to integrate biodiversity into policy and practice. Those taking up careers in agriculture would benefit learning about agro-biodiversity and non-agricultural ecosystem services while those learning forest ecology would benefit by working with foresters and forest extension agents. Marine fisheries scientists would benefit from learning about the role of marine biodiversity, including microorganisms, in ecosystem services and would work with fishing industries as well as local fishers to develop sustainable harvest strategies and conserve natural marine resources. To achieve this, we need to coordinate research with national and regional centers, develop better technologies to monitor and manage biodiversity and ecosystem services, and work to build better good management practice.   23  786  787  788  789  790  791  792  793  794  795  796  797  798  799  800  801  802  803  804  805  806  807  808  809  810  811  812  813  814  815  816  817  818  819  820  821  822  823  824   Action area 6. Develop smart ecosystem governance of terrestrial ecosystems New forms of governance are needed in order to establish sustainable development solutions for ecosystems. While governments have the fundamental role of establishing legal frameworks, private sector and NGOs can bring much needed efficiency, creativity and innovation as well as linking to consumers and civil society. It is not always clear, however, how ecosystem governance should combine top down (e.g. law enforcement) with bottom up (e.g. participatory decision making). Ecosystem governance involves nut just controlling the harvesting of goods (e.g., timber, fish, fodder), but managing and overseeing many elements of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to ensure that goods and services are provided in a sustainable way. Such a broad remit would seem to require governments that can levy taxes for ecosystem service use to generate revenue for management, something NGOs and the private sector cannot do. Further, since ecosystem services include regulatory services that reduce environmental risks, ecosystem governance could fall under national insurance programs and again be appropriately managed by governments. In contrast, ecosystem governance might be better run by a bottom-up approach where indigenous knowledge better serves management . Smart ecosystem governance would reflect new approaches rather than traditional dichotomy of top-down or traditional-bottom up governance. Because most land is not owned by the state in many developing countries and because marine ecosystems are governed weakly, neither national nor international governance may be appropriate for ensuring sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services. On the other hand, because many indigenous populations are impoverished and sometimes marginalized by state governments, they may lack the authority, institutions, and resources necessary for effective governance of ecosystems . Clearly, new, innovative approaches to ecosystem governance need to be developed, approaches in which the strengths inherent in both top-down and bottom-up approaches are brought together. A good example of mechanisms for working towards smart governance are roundtables such as Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and the Roundtable on Responsible Soy . These cases show how private companies can engage with civil society and producers to collaborate and improve sustainability on such production chains, implement best practices and guarantee compliance of the sectors. Another case is the governance structure of the FONAFIFO (see Solution 2, above). In this initiative, governments, NGOs and private companies work together to channel funds from taxes and private business to rural producers who conserve or restore their properties. Another good example is the Model Forest system, with an international Network divided into Regional Networks. Is a bottom-up approach, but within the national regulations and international initiatives, thus considering also top-down elements of the equation   24   825  826  827  828  829  830  831  832  833  834  835  836  837  838  839  840  841  842  843  844  845  846  847  848  849  850  851  852  853  854  855  856  857  858  859  860  861  862  863  864  865  Action area 7. Improve management and governance of oceans Oceans, which comprise two-thirds of the Earths surface and provide crucial global ecosystem services, need special attention. Oceans, as the worlds largest global commons, urgently require activities that work across government, NGO, private, and other sectors. There are few examples of promising initiatives that need to be reinforced. There are several agencies, such as the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO), International Institute of Fisheries Economics & Trade (IIFET), and The International Whaling Commission that bring together different sectors concerning marine science, conservation, and policy, but they lack regulative authority abilities to develop and employ PES programs. Smart governance of marine sustainable development, however, needs to go beyond these efforts. Over the intervening years of implementing SDSs, we will need to improve and harmonize legal frameworks for oceans and coasts and ensure that they take into account current and future uses of marine resources by the complex, international set of stakeholders. Achieving smart marine sustainable development governance will also have to focus on ensuring that coastal communities remain resilient through climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, by funding the development of new and innovative means for achieving marine sustainable development, and by ensuring that costs, benefits, and responsibilities are shared among all parties. These activities require the sort of integrated and multi-level ocean governance that is currently absent. Smart sustainable  development solutions couple  marine and terrestrial  biodiversity and ecosystem  services.  Critical to developing smart marine sustainable development governance will be developing a framework for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean  including energy, industry, government, conservation and recreation  to make informed and coordinated decisions about how to use marine resources sustainably. MSP is already being used within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), however, it will be necessary to extend it to areas beyond national jurisdiction. Furthermore, marine ecosystems will similarly require smart development of its biodiversity and ecosystem services, though the massive scale and complex international governance issues of open ocean systems will require considerable investment to develop and implement tractable solutions. Guiding principles for smart sustainable development solutions for oceans will be to first ensure that basic life-sustaining and regulating functions of the oceans (oxygen production, key processes in the climate system, and in the hydrological cycle) are not jeopardized by development. This will require developing multi-sectorial roundtables and authoritative bodies that can regulate development activities that alter these functions. Such activities may not be   25  866  867  868  869  870  871  872  873  874  875  876  877  878  879  880  881  882  883  884  885  886  887  888  889  890  891  892  893  894  895  896  897  898  899  900   limited to marine ecosystems management since fish consumption and markets, marine shipping traffic and vessel regulations, agricultural runoff and pollution are often partially or wholly terrestrially based. Similarly, climate change mitigation efforts that limit carbon dioxide emissions derived primarily from fossil fuel burning and forest degradation, though terrestrial activities, are important for preventing further ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation. Smart sustainable development solutions couple marine and terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services. A second guiding principle to smart marine sustainable development is to ensure healthy and productive marine environments meaning that all ocean and coastal provisioning and non- provisioning services are considered. Smart marine sustainable development solutions should not be just about fish, for example, but about ensuring that the exploitation of all living marine resources are held within safe biological limits. Because oceans are severely impacted by extractive industries on non-living resources, such as minerals and fossil fuels, they should be integral parts of solutions. Likewise, the use and protection of sensitive marine areas, the development and distribution of technical capacities for the sustainable use of ocean resources, and providing access to marine information and data to build global capacity for the transparent and open assessment and monitoring of ocean resources will be instrumental to building effective solutions that will require regularly updated status reports of ocean and coastal SDG indicators. All solutions should be in accordance with the ecosystem approach and the precautionary principle. Efforts should be made for urgent implementation of the provisions of the Convention of Biological Diversity, which calls for a major increase in marine protected areas (up to 10% of ocean by 2020). These protected areas should be implemented by national governments in national waters near the coast and by international organizations in international waters. Protecting the provision of ecosystem services of oceans is one of the priority investment for our sustainable future.   26  901  902  903  904  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  912  913  914  915  916  917  918  919  920  921  922  923  924  925  926  927  928  929  930  931  932  933  934  935  936  937  938  939  940  941  942  943  944  945  946  947   Literature Cited Alberts, Bruce. \"Impact Factor Distortions.\" Science 340, no. 6134 (2013): 787-87.

Each report underscores the importance of cities and urban development,3 but they differ markedly in how they propose to address urban issues in the design of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Only the SDSN proposes a stand-alone urban goal, while the other reports suggest that urban challenges be addressed as part of sectoral goals and targets. The UN Secretary Generals report to the General Assembly,4 issued in July 2013, also highlights the importance of sustainable cities and the positive role of SDSN members and partners in paving the way forward towards a post-2015 agenda. This note outlines the case for a stand-alone urban SDG. It explains why alternative approaches that treat urbanization as a cross-cutting issue and spread urban issues across separate goals for infrastructure, social services, and environmental sustainability would fail to mobilize cities or address the essential role that urbanization must play in sustainable development. 1 Note prepared by the SDSN Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities. Supported by UN-Habitat, UCLG, Cities Alliance, ICLEI, and Metropolis. 2 Available at: www.unsdsn.org, www.post2015hlp.org/, and www.globalcompact.org. 3 In this document we use the terms cities and urban areas interchangeably to denote metropolitan areas and all urban centers that have economic or political importance. 4 Available at: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/68/202. 1 URBANIZATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Urbanization will be the defining trend over the next several decades, especially in East Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, where the bulk of extreme poverty is concentrated. Cities, in these and other regions, will play a central role in the ability of nations to achieve sustainable development. Today, half the worlds seven billion people live in cities. By 2030 there will be over one billion more urban residents and for the first time ever in many parts of the world the number of rural residents will start to shrink. Between 2010 and 2050, the urban population will grow significantly, by 2.5 to 3 billion people, increasing the urban share to two-thirds of the worlds population. Urbanization has the ability to transform the social and economic fabric of nations. Cities are responsible for the bulk of production and consumption worldwide, and are the primary engines of economic growth and development. Roughly three-quarters of global economic activity is urban, and as the urban population grows, so will the urban share of global GDP and investments. The right to development for low-income and middle-income countries can only be realized through sustainable urbanization that addresses the needs of both rural and urban areas. It must also be recognized that cities are home to extreme deprivation and environmental degradation with one billion people living in slums. In many countries the number of slum dwellers has increased significantly in recent years, and urban inequality is deepening. The dynamism of cities represents a major sustainable development opportunity. By getting urban development right, cities can create jobs and offer better livelihoods; increase economic growth; improve social inclusion; promote the decoupling of living standards and economic growth from environmental resource use; protect local and regional ecosystems; reduce both urban and rural poverty; and drastically reduce pollution. Sound urban development will accelerate progress towards achieving SDGs, including the end of extreme poverty. On the other hand, mistakes made in managing urban growth are very hard to undo. Infrastructure investments, urban land-use systems, and layouts are literally cast in stone  with impacts that may be difficult to alter for many decades. Without adequate management and investments, slums may expand, and cities may fail to generate the jobs necessary to improve livelihoods. As a result, inequalities, exclusion, and violence may increase. Countries may fail to decouple economic development from resource use, and cities may fail to provide economic opportunities to surrounding rural areas and become vulnerable to climate and other environmental changes. Cities around the world are struggling to accommodate their rising populations and address the multi- dimensional challenges of urban development. If current trends continue, few countries stand to reap the benefits of sustainable urban development. The stakes are high. How the SDGs address the urban challenge and how cities promote a shift away from business as usual is of paramount importance to the post-2015 development agenda. 2 WHY THE WORLD NEEDS AN URBAN SDG A dedicated and stand-alone urban SDG will accomplish the following: 1. Educate and focus attention on urgent urban challenges and future opportunities: The Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) have successfully educated leaders and the public about important dimensions of extreme poverty. The SDGs must similarly educate leaders and the public and focus their attention on the urgent challenges and opportunities of sustainable urban development from 2015 to 2030, in order to improve the lives of slum dwellers, provide access to basic infrastructure services, protect local and regional ecosystems, and ensure resilience. The need to educate leaders and the public on re-imagining sustainable urban development pathways is particularly urgent because cities as usual will not suffice. Despite strong track records of many local governments, cities in general are not well equipped to address emerging urban challenges. They are under-resourced and disempowered. Many lack the competencies needed to address the complex multi-sectoral challenges they face. Poor cities are contending with rising populations, inadequate infrastructure and basic services, and increasing pollution. Many rich cities face challenges of shrinking populations, a shrinking economic and livelihood base, aging infrastructure, and the need to meet lifestyle aspirations within planetary boundaries. Unless these challenges are addressed many poor and rich cities could lock themselves into an unsustainable and unlivable future. 2. Mobilize and empower all urban actors around practical problem solving: The challenges and opportunities presented by urbanization are complex and context-specific. Success will require practical problem solving. The SDGs must mobilize all urban actors, including local authorities, mayors, urban NGOs and community organizations, universities, businesses, and national authorities to respond to the challenge and opportunity of global urbanization. A dedicated urban SDG is needed to mobilize all of these urban stakeholders to act in concert. In the absence of a dedicated goal, the SDGs are unlikely to promote the improvements in governance needed by both rich and poor cities alike. Today, local authorities, businesses, and community organizations that should be working together to address urban challenges are often at loggerheads and acting in isolation. Outcomes of academic studies on urban sustainability dont always reach decision-makers. A dedicated urban SDG will highlight the challenges and opportunities of urban governance that must be addressed if cities are to prosper. Such a goal will empower city governments, and support inclusiveness by empowering community organizations and a broad range of urban stakeholders to demand sound governance. It will mobilize public-private partnerships, and help build a bridge across the rural-urban divide. 3. Address the specific challenges of urban poverty and access to infrastructure: The characteristics of urban poverty differ in several ways from rural poverty. In urban settings, the extreme poor must pay for food, water, fuel, housing and other basic needs that typically cost less in rural areas. While $1.25 per day may be a good definition of extreme poverty in largely rural areas, this threshold is often too low in cities. Likewise, several indicators for access to and use of basic infrastructure services have been designed for rural settings and are not suited for an urban context. These definitional and measurement issues have major policy implications. They point to the need for a dedicated urban SDG to sharpen the focus on better ways to address urban poverty, access to infrastructure and basic services, housing and security of tenure, and the institutional arrangements needed to fund, implement, and track progress in meeting these objectives. 3 Well-run cities are proven fighters of poverty. An urban SDG will enable an integrated approach to improving the lives of the urban poor, particularly slum dwellers. The MDGs showed the benefit of focusing on slum dwellers, but despite improvements in the lives of millions, increased urbanization and a rapidly growing poor urban population has resulted in an increase in the overall number of slum dwellers worldwide. An urban SDG is needed to more systematically address the dynamic nature of urbanization, create opportunities for change for the urban poor, such as targeted investment in slum areas, and create a space for their engagement and participation in local decision-making and institution building. 4. Promote integrated and innovative infrastructure design and service delivery: The challenges faced by cities are interconnected and must be dealt with in an integrated manner. Innovative infrastructure design, modern technology solutions, and smart systems offer tremendous opportunities for improving access to basic services and lowering their cost, increasing efficiency, reducing per capita consumption of environmental resources, and reducing pollution. These opportunities can only be seized through integrated infrastructure planning processes that span multiple services: water and sanitation, energy, transport, broadband communications, and housing. Integration must occur at the city level and will be promoted by a dedicated urban SDG. 5. Promote land use planning and efficient spatial concentration: The spatial concentration of urban areas is a unique characteristic that enables economies of scale and scope, efficient delivery of services, and effective use of amenities. However, urban land use is often growing more rapidly than urban populations, leading to an urban density decline in many parts of the world. Good spatial planning can minimize urban land use footprints and increase the efficiency of service provision. Well-planned, mixed-use, and compact cities generally offer higher levels of well-being at lower levels of resource use and emissions. An urban SDG is needed to converge land-use planning with economic development, livelihood creation, and the delivery of sustainable transportation, energy, water, and communications infrastructure. An urban SDG will promote effective and integrated management of cities, suburban, peri-urban, and exurban areas, as well as effective management of urban ecosystems and rural development. 6. Ensure resilience to climate change and disaster risk reduction: Cities are responsible for the majority of global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as much of the activity to reduce such emissions. At the same time they are particularly vulnerable to temperature rise, flooding, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. Integrating resilience planning and disaster risk reduction into city management and infrastructure design requires site-specific strategies and city-level targets that are best promoted through an urban SDG. 4 WHAT WOULD AN URBAN SDG MEAN FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS? interventions. National governments will be called on to support Local governments. Many local governments have a strong, positive track record of promoting sustainable development. An urban SDG will support these efforts and provide higher visibility with national governments, donors, and private sector investors. An urban SDG will support local governments in taking decisive action to implement multiple targets that cut across sectors and institutions, with the support of national governments, international agencies, and, most importantly, local agents of change from the private and civil society sectors, universities, and common citizens. National governments. An urban SDG will provide an opportunity to establish coherent national policies for urban issues, promote regulatory frameworks, facilitate investment planning, and coordinate multiple sectoral local/city governments in achieving urban targets and will benchmark and monitor national and city-level progress in meeting them, enabling more effective SDG implementation. Private sector. The private sector  ranging from household enterprises to transnational corporations  will rally around an urban SDG to: promote the financing and delivery of infrastructure, goods, and services; enhance urban governance; and strengthen measures to reduce climate and disaster risk. Civil Society. Cities are the crossroads where diverse cultures meet and are therefore prime locations for demonstrating innovative social and cultural institutions. An urban SDG will open up a space for engagement and participation in local decision-making, cultural exchange and understanding, and enable civil society to connect with the informal and community sector. It will provide a framework for demanding better governance and increased accountability. THE WAY FORWARD The case for an urban SDG is extremely strong. It will mobilize cities and promote the integration of the economic, social, environmental, and governance dimensions of sustainable development. Such a systems approach to urban development offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities presented by rapid urbanization and avoiding its potential pitfalls. A coordinated effort via an urban SDG could transform the lives of vast numbers of urban dwellers, across a wide range of countries with very different income levels. An urban goal and its targets must be carefully framed to address key issues. It must be universally applicable, while permitting an adaptable set of indicators to accommodate differing development stages (e.g. rapidly growing small cities and more stable, or shrinking, large cities) in all parts of the world. The urban goal must be limited in scope to remain manageable and implementable by 2030, and must be mirrored by coordinated regional interventions to address the specific challenges of rural development. The SDGs proposed by the SDSN have been designed to respond to these needs. The SDSN Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities will work with other actors interested in sustainable urban development to promote an urban SDG and to think through the framing and implementation of such a goal, based on city and national experiences. It is also available to brief interested member states, United Nations agencies, multilateral and bilateral agencies, local government associations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on the sustainable development opportunities and challenges in the worlds cities. To inform the broader debate on the post-2015 development agenda, the SDSN is working with a number of cities in major world regions to better understand challenges and to think through solutions in operational detail.

Why aren't important urban issues like health and education included in the urban SDG proposed by the SDSN? Though many cities deliver education and health services to their populations, the SDSN proposes to address health and education through universal national goals. Regardless of where a child is born, he or she should have access to high-quality education. Likewise, universal health delivery requires integration at the national level, with the nature and quality of services provided not distinguishing between populations within a country. 2. Wont an urban SDG promote separation between urban and rural areas? Some argue that distinct urban and rural goals would draw an artificial separation between urban and rural areas. Yet, sustainable development challenges and governance and institutional arrangements in many countries differ significantly between rural and urban areas. Hence, separating these goals is sound from an analytical, institutional, and operational perspective. Experience from countries across all income levels suggests that strong urban-rural linkages, especially around economic development, employment, and regional infrastructure and ecosystem services, are important to achieving sustainable development outcomes and ending extreme poverty. An urban SDG would support these processes and attempt to bridge this limiting dichotomy. 3. Isnt an urban goal too broad and unmanageable? Some fear that an urban goal would become too broad and therefore unmanageable in implementation. This concern is valid. For this reason the SDSN proposes to limit the scope of an urban goal to the issues that require an urban lens, and careful integration with other urban challenges. Major issues like health, education, food security, and decarbonizing the energy system are best managed through dedicated goals that apply to entire countries, and can be complemented by the urban institutional arrangements and capacities that are built to deliver an urban SDG. 4. What about the fact that there are different definitions of urban? A related argument against an urban goal is that the world lacks a universal definition of what constitutes an urban area, and that as a result an urban SDG would be ill conceived. It is true that definitions for urban and rural areas differ across countries, partly for historical and cultural reasons, but with increasing urbanization, the lower bound of population sizes for cities will tend to converge. Within the urban SDG framing, there is no strict need for countries to adhere to an exact urban definition to implement and measure progress against national and city-level targets and indicators. 6 Enabling Transformative and Sustainable Development  The Urban Opportunity:   Background Paper for the      Co-Chairs   Members   High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the   Post-2015 Development Agenda  Prepared by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network  Aromar Revi, Director, Indian Institute of Human Settlements, Bangalore  Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities  Earth Institute at Columbia University, New York  Cynthia Rosenzweig, Senior Research Scientist, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and  Zubaid Ahmed (Citi Institutional Clients Group), Tania Araujo-Jorge (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation), Frances  Beinecke (Natural Resources Defense Council), Somsook Boonyabancha (Asian Coalition for Housing Rights),  Martha Delgado (Global Cities Covenant on Climate Secretariat), Shobhakar Dhakal (Asian Institute of  Technology), Peter Head (Ecosequestration Trust), Vijay Jagannathan (World Resources Institute), Israel  Klabin (Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development), Shagun Mehrotra (The New School University),  Claude Nahon (EDF France), Martin Oteng-Ababio (University of Ghana, Legon), Steward Pickett (Cary  Institute of Ecosystem Studies), Edgar Pieterse (University of Cape Town), Debra Roberts (eThekwini  Municipality), Josep Roig (United Cities and Local Governments), Jonathan Rose (Jonathan Rose Companies),  David Satterthwaite (International Institute for Environment and Development), William Solecki (CUNY  Institute for Sustainable Cities), John Thwaites (Monash Sustainability Institute, ClimateWorks Australia),  Rafael Tuts (UN-Habitat), Elaine Weidman (Ericsson)   Bonnie Scarborough  Program Manager  Aromar Revi, Cynthia Rosenzweig, Shagun Mehrotra, William Solecki  Bonnie Scarborough, Guido Schmidt-Traub, Emma Torres, Rafael Tuts  Shobhakar Dhakal, Amanda Eaken, Peter Head, Garima Jain, Manfred Konukiewitz, Carole Ory,  Martin Oteng-Ababio,  Aromar Revi, Cynthia Rosenzweig, Josep Roig, David Satterthwaite,  Coordinating Lead Authors  Bellagio Writing Team    Somayya Ali, Garima Jain, Matthew Woundy, Susan Yoon  Research Scientists    May 20, 2013  Table of Contents Executive Summary Chapter 1.

Current urbanization trends indicate that an additional three billion people will be living in cities by 2050, increasing the urban share of the worlds population to two-thirds. Cities face major challengesextreme urban poverty, poor living conditions for one billion slum dwellers, constraints on productivity due to lack of basic infrastructure, and risks due to natural disasters and climate change. However, they also have an extraordinary potential for transformational change due to their: concentration of economic activity, potential for social transformation, high levels of annual investment in infrastructure and buildings, high degree of innovation, nimble local governments, connection to surrounding rural and natural environments, ability to reduce eco-footprints by densification, and suitability for systems-based solutions. A Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on cities could maximize the potential for the dynamics of global urbanization to be directed towards sustainable development solutions for pressing urban problems. We propose a post-2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to Empower Inclusive, Productive, and Resilient Cities. The draft goal aims to make all cities socially inclusive, economically productive, environmentally sustainable, and resilient to climate change and other risks. In addition, the goal proposes that cities develop participative, accountable and effective city governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation. An urban SDG might include the following three targets:  Eliminate extreme urban poverty, expand employment and productivity, and raise living standards, especially in slums and informal settlements.   3   Ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services: housing, water, sanitation and waste management; low-carbon energy and transportation; and communication.  Ensure safe air quality and water quality for all, and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, efficient land and resource use, and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards. The success of the SDGs will be determined to a large extent in the worlds cities, which lie at the fulcrum of employment creation, eradication of extreme poverty, inclusive economic growth, and environmental sustainability. The proposed framework of targets and indicators provides a roadmap for operationalizing an urban SDG. The framework lays out the tasks needed to build urban capacity to address sustainability goals, and the metrics by which to identify success and measure it at the appropriate level of action: neighbourhood, city, region, or nation. To reduce urban poverty in all its forms, end slum formation, increase productivity, and promote conditions for global sustainability, cities will need to ensure universal access to basic urban infrastructure and services: housing, water, sanitation, waste management, low-carbon energy and transportation, and information and communication technologies. Urban areas must invest in strategies to increase resilience to disasters, extreme weather events, and other threats of climate change. Transformational technologies, such as information and communications technologies, can help improve city governance, energy and resource use efficiency, and delivery of urban services, and create new employment opportunities. Equitable and efficient urban land and resource use is essential, as is nurturing urban ecological integrity and its linkages to rural and regional systems.   4  To harness the potential of sustainable urbanization, city governance will have to be improved in virtually every country. Metropolitan areas and urban local governments will be at the center of decision-making and therefore need to be empowered, but they must work with many actors: e.g. national governments, local authorities, businesses, knowledge institutions, and civil society. Together these actors must mobilize the needed financial, institutional and human resources across a broad range of urban issues, such as jobs, housing, services, and infrastructure.

Introduction The Millennium Declaration in 2000 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) successfully focused the worlds attention and action on ending extreme poverty by 2015. In 2012, the Rio+20 Summit resolved to finish the job, and called for a new set of goals, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable development was envisioned as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions: economic development, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and good governance. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) was launched by the United Nations Secretary General in 2012 to mobilize global scientific and technological knowledge to focus on the challenges of sustainable development. The SDSN is organized into thematic groups around key issues such as poverty, health, education, energy, and cities. The SDSN has proposed ten priority challenges, which may form a plausible basis for the SDGs called for at Rio+20. In this paper, the SDSN thematic group on Sustainable Cities outlines the historic opportunity currently faced by the global community to transform cities1 along sustainable development pathways and to leverage the growth, investment, and social and technological innovation that will occur in cities over the next several decades. 1.1 Empowering Inclusive, Productive, and Resilient Cities The SDSN proposes that an SDG to Empower Inclusive, Productive, and Resilient Cities be considered.2 This draft goal aims to make all cities socially inclusive, economically productive,                                                          1 In this paper we use the terms cities and urban areas interchangeably to denote metropolitan areas and all urban centers that have economic or political importance. 2 Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development. Available online at: http://unsdsn.org/resources/.  6  environmentally sustainable, and resilient to climate change and other risks. In addition, the goal proposes that all cities develop participative, accountable and effective city governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation. The draft goal might include these three targets:  Eliminate extreme urban poverty, expand employment and productivity, and raise living standards, especially in slums and informal settlements.  Ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services: housing, water, sanitation and waste management; low-carbon energy and transportation; and communication.  Ensure safe air quality and water quality for all, and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, efficient land and resource use, and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards. These three targets provide a framework for promoting sustainable development in cities. Although issues such as health, education, and agriculture are of vital importance to cities and their inhabitants, the draft urban SDG does not explicitly address them because they are addressed in other proposed SDGs. The targets presented here focus on three critical issues for cities that will not be covered elsewhere. Each target contains multiple elements, analyzed in greater detail below. The significant roles played by the crosscutting processes of urban governance, financing, and urban planning are also examined. In order to delineate how progress towards the targets can be measured and evaluated, a preliminary set of indicators is proposed.   7  Cities around the world are highly diverse. The needs and priorities of cities in low-income countries are different from those in middle- or high-income countries. The challenges and opportunities faced by small- and medium-sized cities are different from those faced by mega- cities with populations of 10 million or more. These cities are now deeply interconnected, however, via the global economic system; information, trade, and financial flows; and global environmental challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Despite their diversity, there are many common themes that run through cities. 1.2 Urban Sustainability, Human Rights, and the Right to the City The proposed urban SDG is based on local, national, and global targets. These targets are based on a set of assertions derived from an established United Nations human rights framework. The most elaborated right related to sustainable cities is the right to adequate housing, which includes several core elements: legal security of tenure, including protection against forced evictions; availability of services, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage and refuse disposal; affordability, in that housing costs should not compromise occupants enjoyment of other human rights; accessibility, taking into account the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups; habitability, providing physical safety, adequate space, protection from the elements; location, in relation to employment opportunities, health care, schools, childcare centers; and cultural adequacy (CESCR, 1991). Another powerful principle that has partially informed the work of this paper is the concept of the Right to the City, conceived as a demand for a transformed and renewed access to urban life (Lefebvre, 1996). It has been described as more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is moreover, a common, rather   8  than an individual right, since this transformation depends on the exercise of the collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization (Harvey, 2008). A number of popular movements, including the slum and shack dwellers movement, have incorporated the idea into their struggles. As a result, in 2001, Brazil passed a federal law premised on the idea of the Right to the City that created a new legal-urban order to provide land access and equity in large urban cities that has influenced thinking and policymaking around sustainable cities in many parts of the world. 1.3 The Urban Opportunity The on going transformation to a global urban society offers an unprecedented opportunity to use the urbanization process as a catalyst for sustainable economic and social development. Well- managed cities that are highly connected can use technology effectively to enable greater equity and inclusion, can improve societal wellbeing and achieve greater economic growth at lower rates of resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, and social costs. For the first time in human history, a majority of the worlds population now lives in urban areas. Projections indicate that the urban portion of the global population will continue to rise over the next few decades, reaching 67 per cent by 2050 (DESA, 2012). For this reason alone, sustainable development efforts must focus strongly on urban areas. In addition, cities have special characteristics that make them particularly effective as platforms for transformative and sustainable development:  Cities concentrate and can accelerate economic activity. The concentration of economic activity in cities contributes significantly to national and global output and employment. Today, 600 cities account for 60 per cent of the worlds gross domestic  9   product (GDP) (McKinsey, 2011).3 Hence, cities are key drivers and participants in a sustainable development transition.  Urban infrastructure investment can enable growth, employment, and poverty reduction. Annual urban infrastructure and building investments are expected to rise globally from $10 trillion today to more than $20 trillion by 2025, with urban centers in emerging economies attracting the majority of this investment (Dobbs, 2012). Investment decisions in sustainable long-term urban infrastructure can have far-reaching impacts on the social and economic welfare of urban dwellers, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience.  Urban areas are sites of social transformation. In many parts of the world, urban areas have enabled social transformation and inclusion through processes such as investment in human development, addressing asymmetries of gender, race, age and ethnicity and the participation of citizens in governance.  Local governments are nimble. Local city governments often have the ability to respond more rapidly to the needs of their populations. They can therefore more quickly and flexibly adapt their policies and actions to follow sustainable development pathways.  Cities are sites of innovation. Cities are the crossroads where diverse cultures meet, contest, evolve, and change. They represent and offer rich opportunities for creativity, new ideas, and synergy between groups. The geographic concentration of cities promotes new knowledge generation and the spread of ideas and creativity. Cities are therefore 3 Across countries, the urban share of national GDP ranges from an average of 55 per cent in low-income developing countries to an average of 85 per cent in high-income developed countries. In each case, urban share of GDP exceeds the urban share of population (Weiss, 2005).                                                           10  prime locations for demonstrating emerging technologies, as well as innovative social and cultural institutions.  Cities are interconnected with rural areas. The development of sustainable urban centers has synergies with surrounding rural areas and communities via economic and employment linkages. Urban poverty reduction can positively impact rural poverty reduction. Rural areas help provide the ecosystem services and food security essential to urban functioning and sustainability.  Cities are interconnected with the natural environment. Sustainability requires that urbanization occur within regional and planetary limits of ecological and other life- support systems. Sustainable development actions taken at the city level can significantly impact the natural environment and health, and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental change.  Cities have the potential to minimize our environmental footprint. Well-managed cities that are highly connected and use technology effectively can generate greater levels of societal wellbeing and economic growth at lower rates of resource use and greenhouse gas emissions. A dense urban lifestyle can be greener than its rural counterpart especially in high- and many middle-income countries. Urban residents drive less and live and work in smaller footprints that require less energy, water, and materials per person.4                                                          4 For example, the average New Yorker is responsible for roughly one-third of the green house gas emissions of the average American.  11   Cities are suited for systems-based approaches. Cities are amongst the most complex and dynamic of human systems. Sustainable urban development requires a systems-based approach to transformation via economies of scale and scope and facilitating rapid social and institutional innovation. Smart new technologies for managing energy, transportation, and communications are ideally suited for networked and dense urban environments, and have the potential to transform urban areas and their surrounding regions in beneficial and sustainable ways.   12  Chapter 2. Ending Extreme Urban Poverty and Raising Living Standards While cities present a unique opportunity for leadership in global sustainable development, they also face multi-dimensional challenges that must be addressed in order to realize the full potential of urban transformation. One such challenge is ending extreme urban poverty. The first target in the proposed SDG for cities is therefore to end extreme urban poverty, expand employment and productivity, and raise living standards, especially in slums. 2.1 Urban Poverty and Slums Cities are home to more than half of the worlds population, or 3.5 billion people. Of these, one billion live in slums (World Bank, 2013). In many low- and middle-income countries, this urban poverty manifests itself in the formation of slums and informal settlements. Even in high-income countries, social exclusion, residential segregation, and persistent pockets of poverty are common in most cities. Factors that contribute to the number of urban individuals living in poverty include the 11 million refugees and 25 million persons who were internally displaced over the past two decades (UNHCR, 2006). By 2050, projections indicate that the global urban population will grow by almost 3 billion to a total of 6.2 billion (DESA, 2012). Much of this urban population growth will occur in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Asia and Africa. Urban poverty accounts for a growing share of global poverty. By 2030, estimates indicate that 40 per cent of urban residents will live on less than $1 per day, and that over 50 per cent of urban residents will live on less than $2 per day (Ferre et al. 2011). In some regions such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in urban areas   13  is already over 50 per cent (Ferre et al. 2011). These figures may be even higher if multi- dimensional poverty5 is taken into account. As noted above, over one billion urban residents today live in such poor quality and overcrowded housing that they can be considered to be slum dwellers. Slums are often informal settlements that lack provision of basic services and where the inhabitants are at risk of eviction. Slum dwellers are typically more vulnerable to hunger, poverty, social exclusion, and crime (especially women and children). In some countries, the proportion of the urban population living in such settlements has declined, usually as a result of upgrading programs where deficiencies in the provision for basic services were addressed over the last two decades. The MDG target of a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 was exceeded. Despite this achievement, the net number of global slum dwellers has grown significantly from 777 million in 2000 to about 830 million in 2010 (UN-Habitat, 2010). Addressing Urban Poverty Over the next few decades, urban economic development must be inclusive, and contribute to ending extreme urban poverty and improving the lives of slum dwellers. Most urban hunger is caused by lack of income, rather than lack of available food. All urban dwellers must have access to sustainable livelihoods and the means to pay for sufficient food for a healthy diet, as well as for essential non-food needs (e.g., housing, water, and healthcare). For those who earn too little or who are unable to find paid employment, social safety nets must be established to address these challenges and as a hedge against inflation that has a disproportionate impact on the poor.                                                          5 The Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index developed by the United Nations Development Programme uses three dimensions of poverty (health, education, living standards) with ten corresponding indicators (child mortality nutrition, years of school, children enrolled, cooking fuel, toilet, water, electricity, floor, assets). This definition reveals different patterns than income poverty. Source: UNDP, 2013.  14  Short-term solutions to increasing income in some middle-income countries might include conditional cash transfers, such as the Bolsa Familia in Brazil (Fenwick, 2009). The effectiveness of such schemes depends on having adequate institutional capacity to ensure that the transfers are accessible, that they are actually delivered, and that they are sufficient to ensure that both food and non-food needs are met. Longer-term solutions include the shared measures that many low-income groups also take to avoid impoverishment and hunger. For example, groups may set up savings accounts or build small asset bases that can be drawn on as needed. The scope and coverage of these support mechanisms should be enhanced. Integrating and Improving Slums Three interventions could help improve spatially concentrated urban poverty within cities. The first type of intervention includes granting security of land tenure, enabling the functioning of land markets, and integrating slum improvement into national, state, and local urban development plans and processes. Second, public and private financing can be targeted to extend basic servicespublic and quasi-public goods like water supply, sanitation, electricity, transport, and connectivityinto these low-income settlements. Third, citizen engagement can enable accountability and better governance. Improving Nutrition via Urban Agriculture In cities where access to food is inadequate, unreliable, or irregular, or where residents lack adequate purchasing power, urban agriculture can serve to reduce poverty and hunger. In addition, local urban agriculture can reduce the cost of food by eliminating the expense of supplying and distributing food from rural areas. These activities can expand access to fresh and nutritious food and create opportunities for urban jobs.  15   Growing plants and raising animals within cities and in peri-urban areas is rapidly growing in importance. Rooftops and building walls are increasingly being used for intensive agriculture, taking advantage of sunlight, rainfall capture and nutrient recycling from city waste. Currently, approximately 15 to 20 per cent of the worlds food is produced in urban areas (Armar-Klemesu, 2000). Strategies that cities can use to support urban agriculture include farm to market infrastructure, safe and sufficient water, distribution services, and seed banks. Improving Health Cities can be associated with good health, with many cities in high- and middle-income countries having high life expectancies at birth and very low infant, child, and maternal mortality rates. But there are also many cities that perform poorly, with infant, child, and maternal mortality rates 20 or more times higher than in healthy cities. A good health care system can contribute much to ending poverty. Improved health care can reduce income lost to ill health and injury, and reduce mortality. Monitoring of key health determinants is important although data on many aspects of urban health, especially morbidity and injuries, are difficult to separate from national statistics. It is also difficult to get data on measures of wellbeing such as mental health and psycho-social stressors. Urban epidemiological profiles differ significantly from rural populations and introduce new risks for urban health systems to address, especially the simultaneous growth of communicable and non-communicable disease. Universal access to good quality healthcare facilities and emergency services is critical.   16  Potential Indicators  Percentage of urban population with incomes below national level, established poverty line metrics (both extreme and non-extreme6 per cent of total)  Proportion of population living in slums and informal settlements (per cent of total)  Malnutrition or stunting prevalence in children under 5 years old (per cent of total) 2.2 Inclusive Economic Development The process of urbanization is linked to a geographic concentration of economic activity and investment, an increase in the proportion of industrial and service sector employment, rising productivity, and often increased employment and economic development. This economic activity can be a driver for sustainable development, but only if means are found to ensure that the urban poor benefit. Local economic development has been used in many cities as a successful strategy to address uneven development and extreme poverty. Pro-poor and inclusive local economic policies can enable city governments to address poverty, unemployment, social deprivation and vulnerability, by promoting youth employment, empowering marginalized communities, and promoting gender equity.                                                          6 Note that the $1 per day per capita poverty line (and its adjustment to $1.25 a day) is not an appropriate indicator of urban poverty. It does not adequately allow for the non-food needs that must be paid for in cities, such as accommodation, water, etc.  17  Informal Economies Although statistics on the informal economy are unreliable, estimates indicate that the informal sector makes up between 48 and 72 percent of non-agricultural employment in North Africa, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates for high-income countries are around 15 percent (ILO, 2002). Informal economies are diverse, and can include a wide variety of activities, such as domestic workers, garment workers, street vendors, crafts people, garbage recyclers, and waste pickers. They can include domestic manufacturing, household and small- scale enterprises, and larger enterprises such as para-transit systems (Carr and Chen, 2001). The relationship between the informal sector and poverty is complex. On the one hand, significant income and gender inequalities exist. Average incomes in the informal sector are substantially lower than in the formal sector, with little or no social security and high occupational health and safety risks. Furthermore, in many parts of the world, a majority of informal sector workers are women. On the other hand, these conditions are contrasted with the observation that labor productivity in some informal occupations can be higher than that of formal occupations. To ensure that economic development benefits the poor, a greater recognition of the importance of the informal economy is needed, as well as less harassment of those in informal employment, such as waste pickers and street vendors. City government must recognize the importance of the informal economy, and the informal settlements that house much of the labor force that the citys prosperity depends on. Ways to address the challenges of the informal sector include: establishing a system of urban entitlements; establishing an urban social safety net; and formalizing informal jobs through state regulation. Initiatives that have been helpful in promoting greater income and employment equity within the informal sector and with the more   18  formal economic sectors of society include: securing identities; enabling land rights; and providing financial access and inclusion, for example, via microcredit. Potential Indicators  Share of urban informal sector of national GDP (per cent of total)  Annual urban net employment creation rate by sector (formal, informal, gender, age) (per cent)  Ratio of urban unemployment to national unemployment rate (ratio)  Urban workforce participation rate by gender and age (per cent of total)  Urban gender wage disparity index (ratio)  Share of urban informal sector workers with access to social protection and security (per cent of total)  Urban mean annual growth in value added per worker (per cent)   19  Chapter 3. Universal Access to Basic Urban Services and Housing The second target in the proposed SDG on cities is to provide universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services: housing, water, sanitation and waste management, low-carbon energy and transport, and communication. 3.1 Access to Basic Infrastructure Services As noted above, annual investments in urban buildings and infrastructure are expected to increase from the present $10 trillion to $20 trillion in the coming decades (Dobbs, 2012), providing an important opportunity to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development through investment. Cities offer economies of scale and scope for both economic activity and the provision of basic infrastructure services (water, sanitation and waste management, energy, transportation, and communications). Investment in these services provides additional multiplier benefits to city, regional, and national economies. The sound management of urban services is therefore central to cities capacity to enable prosperity. Providing basic servicessafe, sufficient and affordable water, safe and accessible sanitation and ecologically efficient waste management, and energy access for allis fundamental to the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers and a necessary condition for economic development, innovation and prosperity. The most dramatic reduction in the burden of disease and child mortality has been enabled by improvements in these services. Lack of functioning infrastructure and inequitable provision of basic urban services contributes to social instability in cities.   20  Access to Water Supply Estimates indicate that individuals need 20 to 50 liters of water per day to ensure that basic needs are met for drinking, cooking, and cleaning (WWAP, 2013). Access to water continues to be a problem in many low- and middle-income countries today, with over 780 million people lacking access to improved sources of drinking water (WHO and UNICEF, 2012). Access to Sanitation and Waste Management Services Adequate sanitation services, including safe disposal of human waste, garbage collection, and wastewater disposal, are essential for ensuring the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease, and improvements in sanitation have been shown to have significant beneficial health impacts both in households and across communities. In 2010, an estimated 2.5 billion people worldwide lacked access to basic sanitation services (WHO and UNICEF, 2012). Although limited data is available on the urban population, it is estimated that in 2000 at least 850 million lacked adequate sanitation (UN-Habitat, 2003). Most cities and smaller urban centres in sub-Saharan Africa and many in Asia have no sewers, and in the ones that do, this reaches a fraction of their population. Fewer than 35 per cent of cities in low- and middle-income countries have their wastewater treated (Mara, 2012). Key challenges to effective waste management include integrating the informal waste sector in developing cities and reducing generation and consumption in developed cities. Particularly in high-income countries, cities must strive to reduce waste   21  contributions to landfills by implementing recycling and composting programs, consistent with a goal of generating close to zero waste.7 Access to Energy Services Universal access to affordable, efficient, and low-carbon energy services is essential for inclusive economic development. For some parts of the world, such as urban South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, access to energy is a key challenge. About 1.3 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity and this number could grow as the population increases (IEA, 2012). Among urban populations, 700 million lacked access to clean fuels in 2005, with 279 million lacking electricity (Mitlin and Satterthwaite, 2012). Energy access for all can be promoted by:  Providing cost-effective, reliable, and available low-carbon generation, transmission, and distribution of energy  Providing energy-efficient centralized and decentralized systems appropriate for housing, enterprises, lifeline and social infrastructure.  Strengthening market and regulatory mechanisms to enable realistic pricing of energy and carbon-emissions with targeted support for poor households and small enterprises. In other parts of the world, the key challenge is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing overall energy use, increasing energy efficiency, and increasing use of renewable energy. Current market and regulatory conditions are not sufficient to drive the global development and deployment of low-carbon technology to the extent necessary for the challenge to be met.                                                           22  7 Zero waste is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. Any trash sent to landfills and incinerators is minimal. See for example: http://zerowasteinstitute.org. Success will require a stronger collaboration between stakeholders and urgent action by governments, in particular:  Increasing energy efficiency, using an appropriate nationally determined fuel mix that enables energy security with agreed upon environmental safeguards and continuous performance improvements;  Modifying urban structure, resource flows, mobility systems and building performance to dramatically reduce energy intensity and carbon emissions;  Deploying large-scale energy efficiency, conservation, smart grid and low-carbon energy systems and technologies at scale through partnerships and pooled research and development for emerging clean energy technologies. Access to Mobility Services Mobility is critical to successful urbanization, as well as social and economic development. It connects people to jobs, markets, essential services and political representation. It enables businesses to contribute to development, by serving new markets and unlocking new resources. Access to mobility is unequal, both between high-income and low-income countries, and within countries and cities. The poor make fewer trips and spend a greater proportion of their time and income getting to where they want to go (WBCSD, 2007). Urban mobility challenges must be addressed to enable inclusive economic development and job creation in cities and mitigate rapidly growing traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Cities should prioritize access to: affordable, low-carbon mobility solutions such as public transportation; safe, active mobility solutions such as walking and biking; and innovative mobility solutions such as shared, purpose-built, lightweight, and/or electric vehicles.   23  Sound land use planning integrated with transportation planning can provide the affordable access, appropriate densities, mix of land-uses, and safety for vulnerable populations that make these low-carbon transportation solutions feasible. Information and Communications Technology Urban dwellers live in an increasingly networked and globally interconnected world, where ICT can play a crucial role in achieving urban sustainable development. These technologies enable participation, a freer flow of information and knowledge, and greater opportunity to encounter diversity. They provide opportunities for creating new enterprises and expanding existing ones, developing and disseminating educational programs, and stimulating cultural activities. ICTs can be used to efficiently and effectively manage finite resources in an urbanizing world, with the potential to reduce water consumption, provide more efficient electricity distribution, and reduce pollution levels and congestion through better traffic management. In addition, they can bring services such as health, education, shopping, and work into the home (ITU, 2013). To realize these potential benefits, applications must work together and interoperate regardless of service provider or vendor. Achieving this will require the development of international standards, harmonized frequency spectrum, and the application of enabling policies and best practices (ITU, 2013). Potential Indicators  Share of urban households with access to safe, sufficient drinking water (per cent of total)  Share of urban households served by safe sanitation services (per cent of total)  Share of urban households provided with waste collection and management services, including recycling and composting services (per cent of total)  24    Proportion of solid waste diverted from landfills to meet zero waste goal (per cent of total)  Share of urban households and businesses with access to affordable8 and reliable low- carbon energy (per cent of total)  Share of urban households with access to cell phones and high speed internet connections (number per 100 inhabitants) 3.2 Affordable Housing for All To end extreme urban poverty, provide basic services, and raise living standards, cities must provide access to housing that is safe, affordable, and of adequate quality. In cities, housing becomes unaffordable, not just as a consequence of poverty, but also as a consequence of families needing to spend a large portion of their income on other basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, healthcare, and education. Higher levels of food insecurity are typically associated with an increased share of income spent on housing. Upgrading Slums Slums, by definition, consist of low quality housing with inadequate access to basic services (UN-Habitat, 2003). Sustainable urban development must focus on raising the living standards of slum dwellers. Slum upgrading is a well-established strategy that can benefit all residents, rather than select beneficiaries, and can effectively induce investments using incentives such as tenure security, housing formalization, infrastructure improvement, and livelihood creation. Imposing  25  formal building standards in slum areas as a strategy to promote upgrading has often been                                                         8 Definition of affordable includes the percentage of household income spent on energy. Accessibility includes not  just availability, but also ability to purchase and reliability. counterproductive, and resulted in a lack of access to shelter for the urban poor. Urban slums in inner cities are often located on lands that have become increasingly valuable and contested. Forced evictions then may occur, although they are contrary to the norms of international law and well-established practices of in situ local economic development and upgrading (COHRE, 2006). Forced evictions need to be addressed via enabling law and policy. Mechanisms for Ensuring Affordable Housing Slums and informal settlements are not a stand-alone phenomenon; they are linked to urban planning and development practices. Most cities, across low-, middle-, or high-income countries, face challenges in providing affordable housing and universal service coverage, especially during periods of rapid growth or decline. City housing policies and strategies sometimes fail to match supply with demand, resulting in large numbers of vacant housing units and inadequate supply of affordable ownership and rental housing. Slum upgrading is most successful as part of a longer- term framework of urban and housing policies, underpinned by appropriate planning. Sustainable housing development strategies recognize the need to: integrate housing with mixed urban land uses at appropriate densities; improve mobility; provide access to employment; and integrate social groups to enable inclusion. Given stratification of incomes, a diversity of tenure types including ownership, cooperatives, shared leaseholds, and various forms of renting and condominiums, are effective in enabling universal access to housing in most cities. Adequate security of tenure is an important guarantee of the welfare of households, and a stimulus to improvements and expansion. A variety of housing finance options should be explored and made available, including mortgage finance, financing for social and rental housing, non-collateral credit mechanisms for owner- builders, credit for developers, contractors, and producers of building materials and components.   26  Cross-subsidy mechanisms, within urban projects, between commercial and housing land uses, and between high-cost and low-cost housing are important to encourage socially mixed development. Potential Indicators  Proportion of urban population living in slums and informal settlements (per cent to total)  Proportion of urban population living in adequate housing conditions (per cent to total)  Total number of urban households subject to forced evictions (number)  Proportion of urban households living in mixed use and mixed-income neighbourhoods (per cent to total)   27  Chapter 4. Resiliency and Environmental Sustainability The third target in the proposed urban SDG is to ensure safe air and water quality for all, and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, efficient land and resource use, and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards. 4.1 Access to Clean Water and Air in Cities Water and air pollution are among the most severe and chronic challenges faced by low- and middle-income cities, whose environmental infrastructure and regulatory capacity are significantly impacted by rapid growth, inadequate ability to invest in advance of new development, and large areas of informal settlements with poor or non-existent services. Inadequate water quality and indoor and outdoor air quality leads to millions of premature deaths each year, especially among children and others who are health compromised (Murray et al, 2010). Environmental health improvements in high-income countries resulted from the transformation of universal drinking water standards and increased access to municipal water, sanitation, and drainage services. This transformation should be extended to all cities, taking into account environmental and resource constraints, to support the process of poverty reduction and slum upgrading. Air pollution has been successfully reduced through a combination of interventions: shifting to clean manufacturing techniques; creating incentives for compact urban development, inner city renewal, and appropriate planning regulations; transitioning to public and active transport, clean household and transportation fuels, and more energy-efficient vehicles; strengthening ICT access to reduce commuting; creating disincentives to unsustainable transportation; and strong   28  regulation of highly polluting enterprises. A package of these interventions will need to be customised to the requirements of individual cities, given their diversity of incomes, fuel sources, spatial structures, mix of transport modes, and institutional capacities. 4.2 Climate Change and Cities Climate change is the predominant 21st century global environmental threat. Urban areas contribute up to 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily because of the concentration of industrial production and construction within urban centers (IEA, 2008). A transition by 2050 from fossil-fuel dominated urban energy systems through low-carbon to renewable energy systems for cities across the world is one of the most important factors that could halt the onset of climate change. The speed and form of this transition will strongly determine the economic, environmental, and social disruption that climate variability and change can cause. A range of strategies and instruments will be required to address the diversity of urban systems and their metabolisms across the world. Increased Urban Vulnerability to Climate Change The continued accelerated growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is projected to significantly impact urban communities and major urban sectors including food, water, transportation and energy systems and public health. A four-fold increase and rise in intensity of urban natural disasters since 1975 illustrates how cities and their inhabitants have become more exposed and vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events (UNISDR, 2011). The further onset of climate change is projected to exacerbate these trends. Cities are expected to experience these impacts in the form of enhanced variability and changing frequency and intensity of   29  extreme events, such as heat waves, intense droughts, and riverine and street level floods that can compromise water supplies and human health. For coastal cities, impacts can include enhanced sea level rise and storm surges that will affect inhabitants as well as essential critical infrastructure, and ecosystems. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Adaptation and Resiliency The challenge of climate change highlights the need for cities to rethink how assets are deployed and people protected, how infrastructure investments are prioritized, and how climate mitigation and adaptation is integrated into long-term growth and development plans. Climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience planning, and disaster risk reduction are frequently discussed as separate processes rather than together. A new resilience paradigm is emerging for cities on how they can continue to develop while developing and integrating climate mitigation and adaptation plans. In most cities across the world, data is increasingly available to determine current and future climate hazards; emissions inventories; vulnerability of populations, buildings, and lifeline infrastructure, and community and institutional capacity that can serve as a foundation to build local resilience. New Urbanisation, Investment, and Harnessing Synergies Guiding new urbanization and redevelopment in existing cities needs to be consistent with enhanced climate resiliency and integrating climate concerns into investment decisions. This is a key transformative opportunity to move toward a more sustainable development pathway. While cities continue to grapple with traditional issues around access to urban infrastructure and services, they are forced to provide that access at ever-greater speeds, sometimes resulting in the failure to consider and plan for risks posed by disasters and climate change.   30  Making infrastructure investments through the lens of climate change can pose challenges, since immediate needs can sometimes supercede long-term and more globally-oriented responses. Emphasizing the co-benefits of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies can help build support for these policies. For example, infrastructure to promote safe walking and cycling, in addition to reducing GHGs from transportation and increasing resilience, can improve air quality and ameliorate public health. Harnessing such synergies will be a key to success. Potential Indicators  Proportion of cities/regions with robust, meaningful Climate Action Plans including mitigation and adaptation strategies (per cent of total)  Proportion of cities/regions with a performance framework in place to analyse whether public investments will reduce GHG emissions (per cent of total)  Proportion of public investment consistent with goals of reducing GHG emissions (per cent of total)  Proportion of public investment spent preparing for worst impacts of climate change (per cent of total)  Proportion of cities/regions with a completed climate and other disaster risk vulnerability assessment (per cent of total)  Proportion of cities/regions with framework in place to target investments to protecting vulnerable vital public assets such as hospitals, public transportation, energy systems, food distribution networks (per cent of total)   31  4.3 Urban Environmental Sustainability Urbanization has profound implications for how societies shape, organise and manage themselves (Solecki and Leichenko, 2006). Sustainable development is only achievable if urban social and economic systems recognize that they are dependent on healthy ecological systems. Sustainability requires that urbanization occur within regional and planetary limits of ecological and other life-support systems. A central element of urban environmental sustainability is the opportunity to strengthen urban biodiversity and the level of ecosystem services provided. An urbanizing world needs specific goals for cities that ensure ecosystem integrity and the conservation of major ecosystem services. Rethinking Urban Ecological Services to Cities Traditional approaches to urban services do not include the vital role of ecosystem services. A rethinking of traditional approaches to urban services is now needed, as well as the development of new tools, such as valuation and restoration of ecosystem services. For example, the health of urban ecosystems depends on access to clean water and adequate soil properties and nutrients. Poorly designed or functioning city drainage can lead to soil and water contamination, flash floods, and ensuing damage to ecosystems and humans. Watershed restoration and protection should be a key objective of reconnecting hydrological processes into urban design. This includes ensuring access to and conservation of scarce water resources, especially in ecologically stressed regions of the world. Managing a continuous influx of people and infrastructure in cities creates pressures on supporting ecosystems both within cities and in their surrounding regions. These pressures vary depending on city size, structure, and spatial organization, as well as on the vulnerability of each specific type of ecosystem. Degradation and fragmentation of urban ecosystems is an important   32  challenge for all cities. These can be addressed by embracing ecological strategies that will enable the provision of safe water and air for all and conservation of biodiversity, as well as a broad range of other ecosystem services for cities and their residents. Soil quality in cities is impacted by contamination, fragmentation, fertilization, and irrigation but can be improved through soil and water management and composting of waste. These in turn will provide health and economic benefits. Successful new approaches to link isolated land parcels into continuous corridors and networks are now being tested. Tree cover in cities makes up a significant proportion of national forestry in many countries, supports rich biodiversity, cools streets, reduces noise and dust, and slows water run-off. There is also a significant potential for carbon sequestration in cities through restoration and management of urban ecosystems. Green corridors are increasingly being established across urban areas to connect rural and wild land with the city for the benefit of both residents and urban biota. These corridors can include lake catchments for water storage, recreation areas, forests, and green streets for walking and cycling. An important benefit of restoring and retaining ecological systems is to enable the active and inclusive connection of humans to nature, the benefits of which can lead to improved human health and broader understanding of the need to protect local, regional, national, and global ecosystems. Temperature differences between urban and surrounding non-urban areas occur due to lack of vegetation and darker materials. These differences tend to more prevalent at night and can lead to increases in cooling energy loads and human health effects associated with physiological heat stress. Earth Observation satellite thermal imaging can be used to measure this and correlate with measurements of urban vegetation abundance measured by Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI). Increased areas of green space and tree planting can have a significant impact on   33  ameliorating the urban heat island effect. As climate change impacts cities, urban ecosystems become even more important economically as a way to reduce heat island effects, buffer and store intense rainfall run-off, and enable local food production. Potential Indicators  Urban Biodiversity Index  Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite data  Urban green space per capita (sq. m. per capita)  Proportion of city catchment subject to appropriate management (per cent of total)  Thermal imaging of Urban Heat Island effect   34  Chapter 5. Mechanisms for Promoting Sustainable Cities An essential enabling condition for achieving the three targets of the urban SDG is the development of effective city governance and financing systems that deepen participation, accountability, and the rule of law. In addition, urban planning presents a powerful tool for implementing effective governance and bringing about sustainable change via effective land use. 5.1 Effective City Governance Cities are emerging as an important new level of governance across the world. Rapid urbanization and urban sprawl have led to the emergence of large metropolitan regions for which a new type of governance model is required. The urban political system in many regions is widening its focus from government to governance, decentralization, and democratization in response to the growing complexity of governing in a globalizing, multi-level context, and the need to engage a range of private sector and non-state actors. Deepening Local Institutional Capacities In all countries, local authorities and urban governments are challenged by the limited human, institutional, and financial resources at their disposal. In most countries local authorities are still learning how to effectively engage with citizens and interest groups around an increasingly complex agenda of change. Innovations, like participatory budgeting9 help link municipal investments to local priorities, enable social sector funding, service provision, and financial, human and material resource flows to poorer areas of cities.                                                           35  9 First developed in Brazil in the late 1980s and now extended to over 1,600 urban centers across the world. Deepening Participation and Improving Pro-Poor Management The physical proximity between the elites, the vulnerable and the deprived is a stark contradiction of most 21st century cities. In a youthful world bursting with aspiration of a better future, media and information access has brought exclusion to the forefront of the public imagination. To address this, city governments have a key role in using urban planning, management, and local economic development interventions to limit urban stratification, exclusion and gentrification by promoting equitable access to employment and socially diverse neighborhoods. Participative local governance helps deepen democratic participation, civic dialogue, and facilitating outcomes that enrich the quality of life of all citizens. Diversity of cultures, in the form of heritage and knowledge, is a vital part of cities, integral to their identity and dynamism as hubs of social and human development. Culture provides identity, agency, and tools for communities to fight poverty. Integrating diversity of culture into governance, based on the needs and expectations of citizens, facilitates participation, intercultural dialogue, and the practice of equality of rights. A New Voice for Movements of the Urban Poor Governance in cities can be strongly influenced by mobilisation of groups of the urban poor, especially if they are able to work with local governments. Inclusive participatory processes with a focus on slum upgrading and service provision for marginalized citizens have been effective in many regions in promoting economic development and reducing urban poverty. Many of the social reforms that have transformed the living conditions and health of low-income population cities in what are today high-income nations were responses to the demands of organized groups of the urban poor. Organizations and federations of slum and shack dwellers, self-employed women and waste pickers have become increasingly important in giving voice to the rights,   36  needs, and demands of the poor. A more inclusive city with strong local government, private sector, and civil society alliances provides the opportunity to change behavior and patterns of consumption, production, and social relations. Over the last few decades, many communities have been unwilling to passively accept the planning decisions of politicians and technocrats that impact on their day-to-day environments. Participation by citizens groups, movements, community-based and non-governmental organizations and the important role of micro to transnational enterprises are changing the landscape of engagement and change in cities and city regions. Deepening Multi-Scale Economic, Social, and Cultural Networks Cities are increasingly connected to each other economically and via social and cultural ties that link together neighbourhoods and communities around concerns such as livelihood security, mobility, and water and air quality. Megacities and mega urban-regions will typically concentrate large proportions of the economic, environmental, and human resources of their countriesrequiring fundamentally new modes of governance, technological and environmental management systems to enable their sustainability. Effective governance is essential to ensure that the concentrations of people, infrastructure, and enterprises work towards sustainability rather than mal-development. 5.2 Innovative Financing Appropriate fiscal and financial instruments such as participatory budgeting can provide the investment needed for greater urban sustainability at neighbourhood, city, and regional scales. The effectiveness of new strategies is dependent on the level of transparency of governance   37  structures, and supported by clear evidence metrics. Intergovernmental financing systems can be restructured to enable greater capacity at local levels within cities (e.g., neighbourhood-level) and in turn provide opportunities for greater accountability and innovation. These new financial arrangements can bring together local interests, private enterprises and domestic, international and multilateral investors with a special interest in long-term environmental, equity and inclusion concerns. It is of course recognized that public resources have become increasingly strained in both developing and developed country contexts and that significant funding progress is in many cases increasingly dependent on private financing. A city region investment fund strategy could be set up to support agreed upon regional objectives, combined with innovative new asset classes of green growth funding, climate adaptation funding and social enterprise bonds. The advantage of such a strategy and potential portfolio approach (depending on availability of funding) is that climate adaptation can de-risk green growth infrastructure assets, and social investment bonds can support skills training to underpin local job creation from green growth investment. Leveraging Investment Finance and Integrated Planning Building on traditional public finance flows at city and regional levels, investment finance can be drawn down into projects that promote urban goals via a variety of institutional structures such as public-private partnerships to deliver a variety of social, environmental and economic outcomes. The use of integrated planning tools to support this could enable greater impacts to be achieved in terms of resource-efficiency and socially beneficial outcomes.

In recent decades, there have been serious limitations in the planning, design, and management of urban land markets, mobility systems, and land-use planning in many low- and middle-income countries. This has lead to a range of inadequate outcomes including: rapid, un-served, peri-urban growth; growth of large slum areas and informal settlements close to employment opportunities; and hyper-dense and poorly serviced living and working conditions for millions of people. These impacts can be compounded in large metropolitan regions and urban corridors that are resource inefficient, segregated, less inclusive, and economically less competitive. Expanding Global Urban Sprawl Between 1980 and 2000, the footprint of urbanized areas across the world grew on average at three times the rate of population growth, resulting in an effective worldwide reduction in density in urban areas (Angel et al, 2012). These two decades of urban expansion in most high- income and a few middle-income countries have been focused on single-use and automobile- oriented development patterns. This trend has reduced the opportunity for achieving minimum densities for efficient and affordable public transportation and walkable neighbourhoods, both   39  hallmarks of efficient, inclusive, resilient, and accessible cities and regions. Rapid urban expansion also has been documented in many developing country settings as well. Impact of Expanding Sprawl and Suburbanisation Especially in high-income countries, urban sprawl brings a well-documented host of challenges including: long commutes, traffic congestion, high vehicle miles travelled, greenhouse gas emissions, loss of farmland, isolated communities, loss of walkability, public health concerns around sedentary living, and often a high household water footprint per capita. In high- and middle-income countries, new suburban communities are often geared towards higher income residents, with a housing market that has traditionally failed to provide sufficient, integrated, affordable housing. In some low- and middle-income countries, sprawl has been associated with increased metropolitan fragmentation and the peripheralisation of poverty and informal settlements. At the same time, in many lower- and middle-income countries, redevelopment of inner city areas has led to forced evictions of poor households out of inner city areas to more distant sites that require longer commutes and that have reduced access to public services. Promoting Walkable and Efficient Cities In order to achieve economic, social and environmental sustainability, cities and regions need to re-embrace compact, walkable, and mixed-use neighborhoods. This requires a shift away from the mono-functional city of low density and long distances, which is poorly connected, socially divided and economically inefficient. New communities can be planned and existing communities can be retrofitted to provide greater access to public transportation, job centers, and other daily amenities. Advantages include reducing travel distances, reducing travel costs, reducing transportation energy use and emissions, reducing service delivery costs, saving valuable resources and farmland, optimizing land use, promoting social diversity, and improving   40  public health by providing everyday opportunities for walking and cycling. The creation of walkable communities must be accompanied by the provision of accessible and enjoyable public open spaces, as well as the creation of low-carbon public transportation. Smart land use planning, zoning, and building codes should promote such mixed-use, higher density, mixed- income communities. Reasserting the Importance of Urban Public Space Reasserting the importance of urban public space is an effective entry point for improving a citys functioning. The ways in which space is deployed and shaped, proximity and connectivity enhanced, and land and place value developed and captured are central to the process of city development. Urban public space is the backbone of the city. It allows people to live amidst complexity, negotiate differences, assert their cultural identities and access resources in ways both formal and informal. Effective policies on the establishment, management and maintenance of urban space are the key to inclusivity, walkability, and access.

Conclusions Rapid urbanization creates a set of significant challenges to governments, private enterprises, civil society, and communities. Collective action by and across these institutional groups can ensure a convergence of entitlements and public policy, enterprise and collective action to support this multi-dimensional transition to an urban world without significant economic, social or environmental disruption. The proposed urban SDG, focused on empowering inclusive, productive, and resilient cities, provides a forward-looking framework to achieve sustainability for all citizens, cities, countries and the planet. While urban challenges appear daunting, there is a great opportunity for cities to play a leading if not decisive role in enabling the local, national and global transformation to sustainable development. Urban sustainable development is complex, involving not only many sectors but also many political entities. An urban SDG is therefore an important mechanism to mobilize and bring together the efforts of multiple actors and stakeholders across a range of urban issues and mobilize the financial, institutional, and human resources to make this possible. The proposed framework of targets and indicators provides a roadmap for the actions needed to operationalize an urban SDG. The framework lays out the broad tasks needed to build the urban capacity to address sustainability goals and the metrics by which success can be first identified and measured at the appropriate level of devolution: neighbourhood, city, region or nation. To reduce urban poverty in all its forms, end slum formation, increase productivity, and promote conditions for global sustainability, cities will need to ensure universal access to basic urban infrastructure and services: housing, water, sanitation, waste management, low-carbon energy and transportation, and information and communication technologies. Urban areas must invest in strategies to increase resilience to disasters, extreme weather events, and other threats of climate   42  change. Transformational technologies, such as information and communications technologies, can help improve city governance, energy and resource use efficiency, and delivery of urban services, and create new employment opportunities. Equitable and efficient urban land and resource use is essential, as is nurturing urban ecological integrity and its linkages to rural and regional systems. To harness the potential of sustainable urbanization, city governance will have to be improved in virtually every country. Metropolitan areas and urban local governments will be at the center of decision-making and therefore need to be empowered, but they must work with many actors: e.g. national governments, local authorities, businesses, knowledge institutions, and civil society. Together these actors must mobilize the needed financial, institutional and human resources across a broad range of urban issues, such as jobs, housing, services, and infrastructure. The success of the SDGs will be determined heavily in the worlds cities, resting on improvements in the quality of urban governance, sound investments, and cities ability to innovate.   43  References Angel, S., J.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) was a powerful statement of intent, and in the intervening years, attempts were made in every jurisdiction to create legislative, administrative, and judicial mechanisms to ensure these values were upheld. At the international level, this resulted in exponential growth of human rights law, judged against three indicators: (a) proliferation of human rights legal standards; (b) emphases placed on human rights within state practice; and (c) take-up of human rights norms by international institutions. Human rights mechanisms tend to focus primarily on civil and political rights, instead of the full spectrum of human rights including socio-economic and cultural rights. As a result these mechanisms have been relatively ineffective in addressing issues of social inclusion, empowering communities in socio-economic terms, or making contributions to ending poverty. The mechanisms have not had solutions for those in the Bottom Billion, nor have cogent legal systems been implemented for inter-generational rights, enabling focus on the environment and challenges raised by planetary boundaries. Viewed from the lens that planetary boundaries may create competition over scarce resources, it is likely that these mechanisms will be unable to stop the furthering of inequality caused by such competition. A further central element that needs to be borne in mind is that human rights mechanisms have traditionally been antagonistic to states, focusing on naming and shaming them for what is deemed poor performance, rather than working collaboratively with then towards finding and implementing effective solutions. A long-term perspective to 2030 and beyond needs to address some of the following trends which are likely to impact gender equality, social inclusion and human rights1:  Ongoing environmental degradation will have a strong impact on the poor and marginalized populations since they tend to (i) depend the most on natural resources for their livelihoods, (ii) live in areas that are particularly prone to environmental degradation; and (iii) are least able to protect themselves against the effect of environmental degradation.  Conflict over scarce resources will become more common as population pressure, local environmental degradation, and global environmental change (in particular climate change) combine to put pressure on vulnerable communities. The resulting fragility is particularly evident in the drylands where pastoralist communities often compete with sedentary farmers over scarce water resources and grazing grounds.  Population growth and fertility rates tend to be highest in poor countries and among poor people, particularly in rural areas. Having large numbers of children early in life increases maternal mortality, disempowers women, lowers per capita investments in children, and therefore increases child mortality rates and poor education outcomes.  Human migratory flows will likely grow in volume and become more dispersed with growing numbers of people seeking refuge in todays emerging countries. Such flows create misery for many migrants, put pressure on weaker populations in host 1 See the framework for sustainable development prepared by the Leadership Council of the SDSN for a fuller discussion of some of these trends. 1 countries and deprive the migrant countries of dynamic and relatively well educated people (brain drain).  The growing importance of the private sector will challenge traditional models of state-led human rights instruments, as governments will need to negotiate policies with business, civil society, and other stakeholders.  Technological change offers new opportunities for delivering social services and income opportunities for the poor, but it also changes the nature of jobs, increases the skill premium, and promotes the winner takes all effect. As a result, inequalities within countries are likely to rise unless counteracted by active policies.  Unprecedented urban growth puts pressure on traditional communities and their organization. The Main Concerns The framework of human rights has not adequately addressed the issues raised above, while nonetheless being successful. The main reasons for this failure concern the nature of the framework, its contents, and how it has been applied. Thus the framework itself consists of UN Charter and Treaty based bodies, which operate in standard setting, implementation and monitoring. The vast majority of the last six decades have focused on standard setting, with implementation left to a state party, and monitoring usually taking the form of naming and shaming assisted by increasingly vocal civil society voices. Rather than assisting solutions however, these interactions have all too often been framed as confrontations resulting in defensive postures and a failure to focus on implementable solutions. The over-emphasis on civil and political rights has skewed content away from the kinds of issues that are of central concern in terms of social inclusion. This has narrowed the human rights remit and restricted accurate diagnoses of human rights within states. For instance, while organizations such as Freedom House can provide relatively accurate pictures of the issue of freedom of speech through its index, this is not necessarily an indicator of the likely pressures within a society. Finally, the processes of human rights have placed overt emphasis on the international level, while it is clear that major innovations and social policy solutions are more likely to emanate at national level. The cumulative result of these factors mean that human rights mechanisms and frameworks have had little impact on the trends highlighted above. A failure to correct the trajectory of human rights law, to make it focus on the needs and challenges faced by vulnerable communities, including women, would mean that inequalities would persist into the future, and issues concerning the environment would be de-linked from the human security dimension of the human condition. Business as usual risks exacerbating the following shortcomings of the prevailing approach to human rights: (a) Excessive reliance on civil/political rights, while ignoring issues concerning socio- economic rights as occurring in a marketized sphere where women and minorities, due to structural inequalities, are less likely to be able to compete as equals; (b) Over-reliance on advocacy as a tool to gain rights, with the result that excluded communities are likely to remain further away from social policy makers, and only gain their rights through expensive processes; (c) Overt focus on individual rather than collective rights, derived from western origin laissez faire governance models, while issues confronting social exclusion need collective solutions; 2 (d) An overt reliance of generating remedies through parliamentary processes is ineffective in terms of vulnerable communities whose access to such mechanisms is limited by their relatively poor rate of political participation; (e) Using human rights as a naming and shaming tool with uncertain political support from many countries, alienates them; (f) The articulation of a human rights-based approach which means different things in different contexts perpetrates confusion; (g) Over-emphasis on States as the primary liable actors for rights violations. Pathways Towards Sustainable Development Stripped to basic principles, the human rights agenda to 2030 and beyond ought to be focused on guaranteeing fundamental equalities, and not non-discrimination. Non-discrimination requires that systems treat everyone the same only valid when each individual or community starts from the same premise of equal access to opportunities. Treating unequals as equals perpetrates new inequalities undermining the human rights project. In terms of any potential framing of goals, this requires that extra attention is paid specifically to the attainment of targets among vulnerable communities, defined (i) in terms of ethnicity, religion and/or language with further attention to women within these communities; and (ii) to women as a category across all indicators. Many developing countries have worked on unpicking persistent inequalities undermining their existence. For example, China has sought to create administrative mechanisms to enable the ascent from poverty of communities in millions. This has been achieved through a series of affirmative actions and policy changes in education, political governance, and linguistic rights. Indias affirmative action measures stem from basic constitutional guarantees of equality, and have challenged culturally ingrained inequalities that form the caste system through administrative processes. New Zealand has worked to create processes undoing historical violations placing the Maori in a subjugated position to the Parekha (settlers) and instituting remedies that challenge inequalities. Lebanon has attempted to create administrative processes to calibrate Christian and Muslim influences through consociationalism (a form of power sharing), while underscoring the need for such divisions to disappear over time. Even Iraq, emerging from the shadow of oppression and subsequent occupation, has sought to create mechanisms to accommodate Kurdish ambitions. Numerous African states such as Uganda and Kenya are engaged in discussions concerning the efficacy of land tenure systems, and the South Africans have demonstrated that socio-economic rights can be made justiciable through access to anti-retroviral drugs. Colombia has led the way on recognizing indigenous rights with echoes in Mexico and Bolivia, while Brazil has sought mechanisms to put the Bolsa Familia scheme on a firm legal footing. These measures each with inherent faults nonetheless represent a departure from time-honed approaches to human rights, involving advocates locked in battle with governments. The UN Human Rights Councils Universal Periodic Review has demonstrated that naming and shaming is not the only human rights tool available. Instead, the pooling of genuine administrative experiences in various contexts is much more likely to yield results. 3 Two Proposals With this in mind the High Level Panel is urged to:  Ensure that the language of human rights, articulated specifically in terms of equality of opportunity and the removal of inequality, features strongly in the post 2015 framework;  That the post 2015-framework emphasize the importance of deriving and developing the use of comparative administrative legal frameworks conducive to combatting inequality;  Emphasize the need for active collaboration, and not antagonism, between human rights mechanisms, governments, civil society and business;  Urge the UN Human Rights Council to be ever more mindful of the indivisibility of human rights, and to pay particular heed to how they impact the development agenda post 2015. The SDSN Thematic Group on Challenges of Social Inclusion: Gender, Inequalities, and Human Rights will explore how it might launch two important initiatives, one to serve as an accurate diagnostic tool, and the other to focus on the generation of solutions to intractable human rights issues: (a) Develop the measurement of human rights capacities in a manner conducive to problem-solving rather than naming and shaming, with particular attention to the socio- economic needs of communities, as well as the rate of access to these among vulnerable groups. (b) Create and maintain a database of existing administrative mechanisms, such as the ones identified above, and to develop these and others as models that could be applied in conjunction with the range of other solutions being proposed. With (a) above, human rights metrics have been negligent in creating accurate diagnostic tools. As a result human rights criticism is all too often rhetorical and single dimensional. The idea is to develop a human rights index to create a diagnostic tool enabling adequate comparison of human rights within states, while catering for other competing imperatives such as the opportunity cost of investing in health or other welfare. Such an index would show how technical support and policy change could have significant impact on human rights, gender parity, and social inclusion within each country. With (b) above, the vast majority of legal models perpetrated throughout the world have derived from the limited experiences of countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and to a lesser extent, Italy and Japan. These models are unsuited to many developing countries. The proposed initiative will make available the models and lessons from a much broader range of countries. The two processes in tandem will enable genuine assessment of performance, identification of areas of concern, and reliance on social policy models that may be appropriate, drawn from other contexts. We would welcome to partner with any members of the High-Level Panel who are interested in contributing to either of these initiatives. 4 Conclusion In short, the to tackle the 2030 and 2050 agendas, the HPLs report ought to emphasize the following points: (a) Social inclusion is fundamental to the post 2015 development strategy; (b) States, civil society, international organizations and the private sector need a collaborative (not antagonistic) approach in seeking active solutions to social exclusion; (c) The indivisibility of human rights is fundamental to progress, with greater emphasis required on socio-economic rights within the 2015 framework; (d) The need for the generation of appropriate legal frameworks to the multi-faceted solutions proposed post 2015; (e) The importance of deriving solutions drawn from state practice around the world, especially in the economic south; (f) The need for the creation of appropriate diagnostic tools to understand rather than criticize competing priorities for state intervention, and follow these up with appropriate models that may be useful starting points. In endorsing this approach, the High Level Panel could make a significant contribution in highlighting that human rights is not a what but who question. In other words, legal mechanisms need to address human security aspects of all, especially the vulnerable, and focus only on problems faced by failures to gain civil and political rights compliance. 5 Womens role in economic development: Overcoming the constraints High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda Background paper for the Prepared by Dr. Sarah Bradshaw, Principal Lecturer, Middlesex University with Dr. Joshua Castellino and Ms. Bineta Diop, Co-Chairs of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network Thematic Group on the Challenges of Social Inclusion: Gender, Inequalities and Human Rights 20 May 2013 1 1. Introduction This short paper aims to highlight the important role women have and can play in economic development. It addresses three questions: what is the evidence base to support investing in women? What are the current constraints on realising the full potential of women in the process of economic development? What are the priority areas of intervention necessary to unblock these constraints? It is focussed on women and on economic development, rather than on the wider issue of gender and development. However, before looking at the evidence base, constraints, and interventions, it will provide a brief context of the evolution of thinking around women and development.1 1. The Evolution of Women in Development to Gender and Development In the 1970s, research on African farmers noted that, far from being gender neutral, development was gender blind and could harm women. Out of this realization emerged the Women in Development (WID) approach, which constructed the problem of development as being womens exclusion from a benign process. Womens subordination was seen as having its roots in their exclusion from the market sphere and their limited access to, and control, over resources. The key was then to place women in development by legislatively trying to limit discrimination and by promoting their involvement in education and employment. The WID approach led to resources being targeted at women and made particularly womens significant productive or income generating contribution, more visible. Their reproductive 1 This paper has been prepared with inputs from the membership of the SDSN Thematic Group on the Challenges of Social Inclusion: Gender, Inequalities and Human Rights, including: Kwadwo Appiagyei-Atua (University of Ghana, Legon), Jan Egeland (Human Rights Watch), Todd Minerson (White Ribbon Campaign), Richard Morgan (UNICEF), Sanam Naraghi-Anderlin (International Civil Society Action Network), Elisabeth Prgl (Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies), Magdalena Seplveda Carmona (UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), and Valmaine Toki (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues). 2 contribution was less well emphasised. While WID advocated for greater gender equality, it did not tackle the real structural problem: the unequal gender roles and relations that are at the basis of gender subordination and womens exclusion. This approach also focussed on what have been termed practical gender needs, such as providing better access to water, which would reduce the amount of time women and girls must spend in domestic activities and thus allow them more time for education or employment. There was no questioning why collecting water has been constructed as a female responsibility, or why improved access to water is a need of women and girls only. In the 1980s, the Gender and Development (GAD) approach arose out of the critique of WID. GAD recognised that gender roles and relations are key to improving womens lives, with the term gender suggesting that a focus on both women and men is needed. More recently, the need to understand how gender intersects with other characteristics such as age, ethnicity and sexuality has been noted. The GAD approach recognises that it is not sufficient to add women and girls into existing processes of development but there is also a need to problematise why they are excluded, advocating that the focus should be on addressing the imbalances of power at the basis of that exclusion. GAD also questions the notion of development and its benign nature, implying a need to shift from a narrow understanding of development as economic growth, to a more social or human centred development. GAD projects are more holistic and seek to address womens strategic gender interests by seeking the elimination of institutionalised forms of discrimination for instance around land rights, or ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from violence, for example (Molyneux 1985; Moser 1989). The 1990s witnessed the rise of rights as many NGOs and agencies adopted a rights-based approach to development. Rights increase the recognition that womens demands are 3 legitimate claims. The most notable success for the womens movement has perhaps been the establishment of sexual and reproductive rights as such. Within this has been recognition of womens right to live free from violence, and a broadening of understanding of violence against women from domestic to gender based. There was also a shift in understanding development as meaning economic development to a more holistic social development focus, yet economic growth remains the main driver. For the majority of large development organisations and agencies, the WID approach has now largely been replaced by GAD, which has been institutionalised within the notion of gender mainstreaming. Mainstreaming involves ensuring that a gendered perspective is central to all activities, including planning, implementation and monitoring of all programmes, projects, and legislation. While critiqued if undertaken merely as a tick box exercise, gender mainstreaming offers a potential for placing gender at the heart of development. However, womens rights, particularly sexual and reproductive health rights, are not universally accepted as rights, and violence against women remains prevalent across the globe, and women still lack full and equal participation in economic and political life. Mainstreaming has yet to succeed and there is a need for a continued prioritisation of integrating women into development. 2. Evidence on the Importance of Women to Economic Development The most influential evidence on the importance of women to economic development has come from research used to support the World Banks Gender Mainstreaming Strategy launched in 2001 (Dollar and Gatti 1999; Klasen 1999). This research highlighted that societies that discriminate by gender tend to experience less rapid economic growth and poverty reduction than societies that treat males and females more 4 equally, and that social gender disparities produce economically inefficient outcomes (World Bank 2001a). For example, it is shown that if African countries had closed the gender gap in schooling between 1960 and 1992 as quickly as East Asia did, this would have produced close to a doubling of per capita income growth in the region (WBGDG 2003). The primary pathways through which gender systems affect growth are by influencing the productivity of labour and the allocative efficiency of the economy (World Bank 2002). In terms of productivity, for example, if the access of women farmers to productive inputs and human capital were on a par with mens access, total agricultural output could increase by an estimated 6 to 20 percent (World Bank 2001b). In terms of allocative efficiency, while increases in household income are generally associated with reduced child mortality risks, the marginal impact is almost 20 times as large if the income is in the hands of the mother rather than the father (WBGDG 2003). Identification of women as being a reliable, productive and cheap labour force makes them the preferred workforce for textiles and electronic transnational corporations. Perception of women as good with money, including being better at paying back loans, has led them to be targeted in microfinance programmes. Recognition of women as more efficient distributors of goods and services within the household has led to them being targeted with resources aimed at alleviating poverty, such as cash transfer programmes. The above shows how the justification for including women in development in economic growth has been an efficiency argument, with equity concerns being 5 somewhat secondary. Critics suggest this instrumentalist approach to engendering development, while bringing economic growth gains, will not fundamentally change the position and situation of women. It is important to note that while gender equality will help bring economic growth, economic growth will not necessarily bring gender equality. Advancing gender equality requires strengthening different dimensions of womens autonomy: economic and political autonomy, full citizenship and freedom from all forms of violence, and sexual and reproductive autonomy (Alpzar Durn 2010). 3. Constraints on Realising the Full Potential of Women in the Process of Economic Development Investment in the human capital, health and education, of women and girls is presented as a key way forward as witnessed by the MDGs. The logic is that educated, healthy women are more able to engage in productive activities, find formal sector employment, earn higher incomes and enjoy greater returns to schooling than are uneducated women (WBGDG 2003: 6). Educated women are more likely to invest in the education of their own children, and they are also more likely to have fewer children. Thus investment in human capital has positive short and longer term/inter-generational outcomes and is good for both productivity gains and limiting unsustainable population growth. However, attention has narrowly focussed on ensuring the equal access of girls to primary education. Inequality of access to secondary and higher education persists, as does the limited engagement of girls in the study of science and technology, limiting the future life and employment options of adolescent girls. Willingness to school, feed, and provide healthcare to girls is far more strongly determined by income and the costs of providing these services than is the case for boys. Sens 100 million 6 missing women is testimony to how girls are discriminated against in terms of the allocation of household resources to the point that it creates a gender imbalance in some societies and countries. Families are often unwilling to invest in the education of girls if this investment is not perceived as bringing them direct economic gains -- girls are valued only as wives and mothers, and/or marriage transfers any potential future gains from this investment to another family. As 1 in 7 girls marries before the age of 18 in the developing world (UNFPA 2012), early and forced marriage remains a key issue and an important factor limiting young womens engagement in both education and economic activities. Justice institutions, from the police to the courts, continue to deny womens right to justice. Women and girls remain unable to access justice, given that in many countries there are still laws that discriminate against women in relation to the family, property, citizenship and employment. Justice systems also do not meet the needs of specific groups of women, such as indigenous women who are discriminated against and face violence in the public and private spheres based on both gender and race (UNPFII 2013). Cultural factors limit womens rights and engagement in the workplace. Religion still has a key role to play in determining gender norms in many cultures and fundamentalist views across the spectrum of religions threaten or deny womens rights, including rights related to sex and sexualities, and to mobility and employment. Economic fundamentalism, policies and practices that privilege profits over people, also deny women their rights as workers and to work. While political culture is important for bringing change, women continue to have a limited voice at the local and national levels, and women are not able to fully participate in formal systems of power. 7 In the majority of cultures unequal gender and generational relations exist within households with the male head having a high level of control. A woman going out to work is often read by others as meaning the man is unable to provide for his family, making men reluctant and thus limiting womens engagement in paid work through violence or the threat of violence. When women do engage in paid work, it can improve their voice in the home and ability to influence household decision-making. It can also lead to conflict in the home, especially if women earn more than men, or womens employment coincides with mens under or unemployment. In the last decades, a crisis in masculinity has been recognised, relating to the changes in mens roles and positions through processes of globalisation, suggesting a need to focus attention on men if these changes are to bring transformative progress towards greater equality, rather than further harm women. Women continue to suffer limited mobility and, in some cultures, women are not able to leave the home if not accompanied by a man, effectively negating any type of paid employment. Even when women are allowed to leave, they may face verbal, sexual and physical abuse from unknown males for being in the street and face gossip and stigma within their own communities. The growing levels and extremes of violence against women have been captured in the notion of femicide  the killing of women by men just for being women, including honour killings. In Mexico for example, the term femicide has been used to describe female factory workers being killed for going against gender norms and engaging in paid work outside the home. One in three women across the globe will experience violence at some stage in her lifetime. Violence against women and girls, or the threat of violence, be it physical, sexual or emotional, both in the private and public spheres, at the hands of known and unknown men, 8 remains a key limiting factor to womens mobility and engagement in processes of development. Women who work at home have limited opportunities. While women are very engaged in agriculture, this is generally subsistence rather than cash crops. It is estimated that women own only 1% of property and lack of rights to inherit or own land, which severely limits womens engagement in larger scale cash crop production. Even when women can inherit land, the need for male protection or labour may mean they will give the land to male relatives. Lack of land ownership may also stop them participating in schemes to improve agricultural output, while lack of wider assets disallows them from accessing loans. Given their lower asset base, women farmers may be most affected by climate change, and while having knowledge of how to adapt, they may be least able to adopt appropriate adaptation strategies. World Bank research has highlighted how the poor are less likely to engage in higher risk- return activities and the result is that the return on their assets is 25-50% lower than for wealthier households (Holzmann and Jrgensen 2000). While not a gendered analysis, womens relative poverty, lack of assets, and lack of experience might mean they are particularly risk averse keeping them from higher return economic initiatives. However, women have been shown to use micro-finance effectively to develop small enterprises and are recognised as good at paying back loans. When women are in paid employment, they are more likely to be engaged in part time rather than full time work, in the informal rather than the formal sector, and across the globe women earn less than men for comparable work. 9 During the recent financial crisis, measures to protect the poor through employment programmes have not considered the gendered dimensions of crisis, yet women may have been more severely affected than men and in more diverse ways. Economic and financial crises cannot be seen in isolation from food, fuel, water, environment, human rights, and care crises (AWID 2012). Women face particular risks during disaster, which climate change may increase, and during conflict. In particular, the risk of physical and sexual violence increases. Agencies not only fail to protect women and girls, but their reproductive and particularly their productive needs are often overlooked in crisis response and peacebuilding. While remunerated work is important for women, it is important to remember that women still undertake the bulk of unpaid work in the home, household plot, or family business. They have the primary responsibility for caring for children and older people as well responsibility for undertaking activities such as collection of water or firewood. Women play the key role in the care economy, which not only provides care to the young, old and the sick, but also is vital for ensuring a productive workforce. As this work is not remunerated, it is undervalued and lies outside general conceptualisations of the economy. Women engaged in paid work often face a double work day, since they may only be allowed to work as long as their domestic duties are still fulfilled. This means women are time poor and the time burden may impact on their health and wellbeing. To alleviate this burden and free women to enter paid work, daughters may be taken out of school to cover the domestic work, with related negative impacts on their education and ability to seek remunerated work in the future. Womens continued inability to control their own fertility means that childbirth limits their ability to engage in productive activities. Even when reproductive health services are 10 provided, this is not enough to ensure womens ability to access them. Men may see the decision over if and when to have children to be their decision, and large numbers of children may be read as a sign of male fertility and power, which becomes more important when masculinity is threatened. In many cultures, discussion of sexualities remains taboo, denying access and rights to those who do not conform to the heterosexual norm. The sexual and reproductive rights of adolescent girls in particular may be overlooked and they may be denied access to reproductive health services if they are unmarried. Research establishes a link between education and womens ability to control their fertility. Studies also show that paid work can promote greater understanding of sexual and reproductive rights among women. Womens socially constructed altruistic behaviour means that economic resources that enter the household via women are more likely to be spent on household and childrens needs. Female-headed households may not be the poorest of the poor as popularly constructed, since women who live with men may suffer secondary poverty-- the household overall is not poor but, as the man withholds income for personal consumption, women and children within the household are poor (Chant 2006). When women earn, men may withhold even more of their income, leaving women and children with access to the same level of resources but improving the position of women through greater control of those resources. This irresponsibility of men has meant women have been targeted within poverty reduction and social policy initiatives. While the targeting of women with resources is welcome, the associated feminisation of obligation and responsibility (Chant 2008) for delivering policy outcomes may not only marginalise men but add further to womens existing triple burden 11 of reproductive, productive, and community management work. It may privilege their reproductive over their productive role and reinforce women as mothers rather than workers. Care needs to be taken to ensure that programmes serve womens needs and women are not merely placed at the service of these policy agendas (Molyneux 2007). It is important to remember that policies to promote economic development that include women but do not tackle the structural inequalities at the basis of their exclusion may bring growth gains, but will not necessarily bring gender equality gains. 4. Priority Areas of Intervention Necessary to Unblock these Constraints Womens groups and movements across the globe continue to promote as fundamental the need to respect and defend womens sexual and reproductive health rights. Womens groups and movements also continue to be fundamental to promoting these rights, but many find themselves under threat for this focus. Sexual and reproductive rights are critical for social and economic development. Without these rights, women and adolescent girls cannot make decisions around fertility, repeated childbirth keeps them from income generating activities and reduces productivity, and early and forced marriage keeps young women from education and employment. Sexual, emotional and physical violence and the threat of violence limits womens mobility, confines women to the home, and keeps them from engaging fully in processes of social and economic development. Men and boys can have a role to play in the prevention of gender- based violence and the promotion of gender equality. 12 Threats to womens rights exist on many levels, including those posed by culture, religion, and tradition, as well as processes of globalisation and economic change. A right gained is not a right maintained unless there is constant monitoring of rights. There is a need to strengthen womens access to both formal and informal justice systems, and ensure these are responsive to advancing all womens equal rights, opportunity, and participation. Improving womens political voice is also crucial here. Womens responsibility for unpaid domestic work makes them time poor as well as more economically dependent on men, yet is vital for ensuring a healthy and productive workforce. While investment in infrastructure such as water, sanitation and electricity is important to ease the time burden associated with these tasks, it does not change how unpaid work and the care economy is conceptualised and valued. Financial, environmental, and health crises intensify the need for care services with the care burden falling disproportionately on women and girls. Policies to provide affordable, quality child care and adequate healthcare services would not only free women to enter paid employment, but also help change care work from being understood as a domestic responsibility to a collective responsibility. This change in how care work is conceptualised and valued should be a longer-term goal. In the short term, there is a need to create full, decent productive employment opportunities for women and access to finance, as well as continue to provide social protection, and more importantly promote and value women as good with money. Key for economic growth is the promotion of womens economic rights which entails promoting a range of womens rights: their sexual and reproductive rights and rights to education, to mobility, to voice, to ownership, and to live free from violence. 13 References Alpzar Durn, L.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was a  powerful  statement  of  intent  and  attempts  have  been  made  to  create  legislative,  administrative,  and  judicial  mechanisms  to  ensure  these  values  are  upheld.  The  devastation  of  World  War  II  highlighted the need and acceptance for human rights and mobilized the political will to create a  framework  that  could  enshrine  basic  protection  for  all.  A  standard  has  now  emerged  to  which  countries and communities across the world subscribe and aspire. The success of the universality of  human rights can be judged against: (a) the proliferation of human rights legal standards; (b) the  emphases placed on human rights within State practice; and (c) the take-up of human rights norms  by  international  institutions.  There  have  been  advances  in  who  is  explicitly  covered  by  these  standards, with notable advancements for the rights of women and children; in how inclusionary the  protection emanating from these is; and in the extent to which they cover the full range of rights.  There have also been significant advances for group rights, initially marginalized within the human  rights framework.    The processes currently underway to define a set of internationally agreed goals for the period 2016  to 2030 provide an opportunity to consolidate these advances. This report highlights the limits of  the existing development and rights agendas and suggests steps needed to ensure an agenda that  moves beyond poverty reduction to focus on social inclusion as an overarching aim, placing de facto  equality  at  the  heart  of  global  sustainable  development  agenda.  This  report  suggests  solutions  reflecting good practice that could provide blueprints for the future, drawn from societies around  the world that are attempting to ensure fairer and more equal societies.   1. Moving beyond Current Practice  Human rights have gained acceptance as universal standards to strive for and provide a framework for  development, albeit with deficiencies. The rights discourse has been critiqued for presenting rights as  universal when in fact they validate Western values. Other criticisms point to double standards: some  States are singled out as violators, while those deemed allies are exempt from criticism. Despite these  major  difficulties,  the  notion  of  rights  has  captured  popular  imaginations  across  the  globe  and  marginalized groups, particularly women, indigenous peoples and minorities, have used the discourse  of rights as a powerful tool to articulate their claims. High among these claims is the continued need  for  protection  from  violence  and  conflict.  There  is  also  increased  convergence  around  the  need  for  socio-economic rights for excluded communities. This suggests that, rather than moving away from  the rights discourse, there is need to change how rights are understood and operationalized.   1.1. Economic, social, and cultural rights  Rights  were  presented  as  universal  and  indivisible.  Civil  and  political  rights  were  prioritized  and  presented as those most in need of protection. By contrast, economic, social, and cultural rights (ESC  rights) were construed as falling within governmental social policy. This distinction was exacerbated  4  by  the  location  of  the  emerging  rights  regime  within  law,  as  a  series  of  nationally  guaranteed  legislative, judicial and administrative measures. Rights thus became a series of promises made by the  State  to  its  people  that  could  be  gained  through  legal  challenge.  Within  this  framework  ESC  rights  were  often  subject  to  the  caveat  that  their  enjoyment  was  subject  to  progressive  realization.  The  rights  articulated  on  socio-economic  issues  were  not  promises  that  could  be  adjudicated  upon  in  a  court of law, but aspirations to be strived for by governments. The emerging rights framework was not  linked  to  the  development  discourse,  and  issues  such  as  poverty  were  conceptualized  within  an  economic rather than rights rhetoric. The sustainable development agenda affords the opportunity to  re-conceptualize poverty: with poverty eradication as a right, with economic growth designed to serve  the achievement of this goal, and a complementary legal framework (administrative, legislative and at  times judicial) to guarantee the aim.    To eradicate poverty, a broad spectrum of rights needs to be fulfilled  for example, an individuals  right to work requires fulfillment of rights such as personal security and freedom of movement (e.g. in  order  to  seek  jobs).  These  rights  also  need  balancing  against  environmental  rights  if  sustainable  development is to be achieved. Thus it remains imperative to return to the notion of indivisible rights  and, rather that privileging civil and political rights, to understand these as interconnected with socio- economic  rights.  This  would  enable  a  holistic  understanding  of  how  poverty  can  be  overcome   something an overly legalistic understanding of rights would restrict to (i) ascertainment of blame; (ii)  determination of costs of violation; and (iii) deterrent legislation to avoid the phenomenon in future.  In the new period of sustainable development, it is imperative to interrogate and incorporate human  rights from economic, sociological, political and gendered lenses.  1.2. Womens and group rights  The issue of gender highlights the limitation of rights as currently constructed. The UDHR reflects a  male-centric  post-war  conceptualization  of  rights.  While  violence  against  women  and  girls  (VAWG)  and marital rape could be understood as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the  gender neutral language does not explicitly recognize these specific violations. In legal terms, VAWG  been conceptualized as domestic violence and thus as a private matter between man and wife, not  one  for  public  intervention.  The  emphasis  within  the  rights  framework  lay  on  protection  of  the  individual, rather than groups or communities, with no recognition of violations that were collectively  experienced by a group. More recently the term femicide1 has been adopted to represent the killing of  women  for  behaving  badly  or  challenging  gender  norms.  This  takes  different  forms  in  different  cultures, including honor killings, the persistent rape and violence against Adivasi women in India and  deaths of women factory workers for challenging gender norms and engaging in paid work outside the  home.  Women  are  targeted  not  because  of  individual  characteristics,  but  for  representing  a  group  envisaged as playing a set role within society. An overt legal focus on prosecuting perpetrators and  protecting victims fails to challenge underlying structural causes which require societal responses.   While  advances  have  been  made,  legal  frameworks  struggle  to  afford  protection  against  collective  violations against specific vulnerable groups. Over reliance on a system where rights can be effectively  challenged in a court of law fails to acknowledge the fundamental inequalities that restrict access to  1 World Health Organization. (2012). Understanding and addressing violence against women: femicide. Available online at:  http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/77421  5  such  systems  for  women,  indigenous  peoples  and  other  minorities.  Social  exclusion  is  particularly  manifest  in  legal  systems  at  the  level  of  advocacy,  judicial  determination  and  within  the  legislative  process.  While  proscribing  certain  behavior  as  illegal  is  a  first  step,  establishing  a  right  does  not  automatically facilitate its fulfillment. To escape violence, women need more than laws: they need to  be able to live independently, to be able to earn an income, to own property, to farm land, and to  have society recognize these rights. Legal mechanisms remain insufficient for bringing excluded voices  into the heart of socio-legal policy over development and rights. Thus the rights of such marginalized  groups  must  be  prioritized  and  ways  to  fulfill  them  outside  formal  justice  systems  must  also  be  promoted.  Cultural  relativism  remains  a  key  challenge  to  be  overcome,  which  pertains  directly  to  indigenous peoples, minorities and women. Sexual and Reproductive Rights for instance are contested  rights, not recognized in many cultures. There is then a growing need to ensure all rights for all, and to  find  ways  to  negotiate  cultural  differences  to  make  sure  rights  are  used  to  promote  and  protect  society against harmful processes and practices.  1.3. Human rights and development  The relatively recent anchoring of human rights to the development paradigm is particularly useful.  Donor  agencies  and  some  development  NGOs  have  sought  to  connect  their  work  to  human  rights  through a rights-based approach to development. While positive, care needs to be taken around this  linkage to ensure that the human rights discourse is not dominated by agents of developmentalism.  The  position  of  international  organizations  such  as  the  World  Trade  Organization  on  issues  such  as  intellectual  property  rights  and  its  negative  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  sustainability  of  food  production,  environmental  conditions  and  the  health  of  the  poor  in  developing  countries  is  a  manifestation of a trend that needs to be challenged. Financial institutions have also adopted rights  and  equality  rhetoric  that  could  dilute  its  meaning.  For  instance,  the  World  Bank  promotes  gender  equality  as  an  efficient  means  to  increase  productivity,  improve  economic  growth,  and  reduce  population growth. While this is based on sound research, promoting it in this manner makes gender  parity an incidental objective rather than an imperative question of equal rights.  Poverty reduction  projects focused on women are also often presented as fostering gender equality. For gender equality  to be achieved requires specific actions that address structural gendered inequalities, unlikely to be  achieved as convenient collateral to other policies. Providing services to women, ensuring access to  health and education, and employment and credit are important, and changing gender roles can have  a positive effect on gender relations. However, this is not automatically the case, since, for example,  improving womens access to income does not necessarily improve their control over that income nor  improve womens voice in the home.  Creating job opportunities for women is important, but there is  also a need to explicitly promote womens right to work.  There is also a need to explicitly address  unequal  power  relations  at  all  levels,  including  within  the  home.   If  real  change  is  to  be  achieved  policies need not only to change gender roles, but also challenge existing unequal gender relations,  and  to  promote  womens  access  to  services  and  resources  as  rights.  It  is  then  important  to  avoid  simple solutions that do not challenge structural inequalities and local contexts.  It is also important to  ensure that the overuse of the language of inclusion, justice, equality and rights does not diminish its  meaning and power, creating convenient rhetoric that circumvents real issues.   The  donor  community  appears  to  view  the  adoption  of  liberal  democracy  by  every  country,  accompanied  by  a  constitution  guaranteeing  rights,  as  prima  facie  affirmation  of  a  States  human  6  rights  credentials.  This  approach  placed  emphasis  on  good  governance  as  a  criterion  for  decisions  concerning disbursement of aid, but it fails to assess critical issues affecting social inclusion, such as  unequal  power  structures,  the  environment,  and  the  proliferation  of  poverty,  and  often  introduces  artificial  elements  for  societies  in  transition  that  work  against  the  longer  term  interests  of  building  sustainable and inclusive communities.    Human  rights  have  focused  on  naming  and  shaming  States.  Many  international  instruments  were  negotiated and ratified as intergovernmental agreements, and failures to uphold their principles was  akin to one party to a contract failing to uphold norms agreed to within that contract. This approach  often  foreclosed  room  for  collaborative  work  between  States,  those  keen  to  find  solutions  for  the  implementation  of  rights,  and  human  rights  defenders.  While  there  remains  a  role  for  States  in  holding other States to account if they violate international agreements, there is also room for more  collaborative processes to bring States into line with international consensus. While States clearly bear  obligations  under  law,  not  every  violation  of  human  rights  is  the  result  of  State  inaction  or  unwillingness  to  act.  Focusing  on  States  as  the  sole  liable  actors  for  violations  means  that  opportunities for behavioral change and adoption of responsibility for others, such as the corporate  sector,  were  missed.  The  processes  of  human  rights  have  also  placed  overt  emphasis  at  the  international  level,  while  major  innovations  and  human  rights-friendly  social  policy  solutions  often  emanate  at  the  national  and  sub-national  levels.  Any  assessment  of  law-making  within  States  highlights  how  structural  inequalities  are  constructed  through  legislative  mechanisms,  and  unless  awareness grows for wider articulation of political voices, inequalities will persist and be reproduced.    A failure to correct the trajectory of human rights law to make it focus on the needs and challenges  faced  by  women,  vulnerable  and  other  marginalized  communities  would  allow  current  inequalities,  borne on structural fault lines, to persist into the future.   The post-2015 framework should therefore:   Ensure that the language of human rights, articulated in terms of the diminution of inequality  and equality of outcomes, features strongly in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) across  goals, targets and indicators;  Seek  guarantees  that  the  SDG  framework  emphasizes  the  importance  of  administrative  legal  frameworks conducive to combating inequality and social exclusions in all its forms;    Promote women and girls sexual and reproductive rights;    Emphasize  the  need  for  active  collaboration  not  antagonism,  between  human  rights   mechanisms, governments, civil society and business;  Seek  ways  to  address  the  structural  causes  that  deny  marginalized  groups,  including  women,  their rights.     2. Overcoming Structural Causes of Inequality  With  economic  growth  as  the  dominant  paradigm,  poverty  could  be  viewed  as  resulting  from  inadequate incomes and productivities, particularly in agriculture and other rural activities and in  7  the urban informal sector,2 due to inadequate access to educational and other services. The poors  relative lack of market power feeds into weak political power via undemocratic structures. They are  also  less  likely  to  engage  in  higher  risk-return  activities  and  the  result  is  that  the  return  on  their  assets  is  25-50%  lower  than  for  wealthier  households.3  While  this  is  important  in  explaining  the  preponderance of poverty, these are also outcomes rather than causes of poverty, with inadequate  incomes,  productivities  and  weak  political  power  arising  from  structural  inequalities,  as  demonstrated in the following four policy areas.  2.1. Macroeconomic    Sound  macroeconomic  policies  are  a  prerequisite  for  economic  stability,  growth,  and  reducing  poverty, yet poorly designed policies can undermine the goal of social sustainability. Rigidly market- centered prescriptions over the past decades have increased inequalities in many countries. There is  an  urgent  need  to  re-embed  macro-economic  and  fiscal  policy  within  the  broader  framework  of  social objectives since growth alone does not lead to social justice.    Research  has  shown  that  societies  that  discriminate  by  gender  tend  to  experience  less  rapid  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  than  societies  that  treat  males  and  females  equally,  and  that gender disparities produce economically inefficient outcomes.4 Extreme inequalities reinforce  poverty and can act as a barrier to growth by restricting the productive potential of a large section  of  the  population.  In  turn,  highly  unequal  countries  have  been  shown  to  be  less  able  to  convert  growth into poverty reduction. While greater equality may be important for economic growth, care  is needed, as growth is not necessarily good for equality. The question is what type of growth is best  for  poverty  reduction  and  which  policies  will  help  to  bring  about  more  equitable  patterns  of  growth.5 The focus needs to be on growth with equity or pro-poor growth strategies.     The  promotion  of  the  economic  rights  of  marginalized  groups  may  hold  the  key  for  future,  more  equitable  economic  growth.  For  instance  fulfilling  womens  economic  rights  entails  promoting  a  range of womens rights such as their right to control fertility, to education, to ownership, and to  mobility. In some cultures women are unable to leave home if unaccompanied by men, effectively  negating paid employment. Women play key roles in the care economy, which provides care to the  young, old and the sick, and ensures a productive work force. This unremunerated work is under- valued  and  lies  outside  general  conceptualizations  of  the  economy.  When  women  are  allowed  to  leave home to work, they may face verbal, sexual and physical abuse from unknown males, or face  gossip  and  stigma  within  their  communities.  To  promote  the  wellbeing  of  women  as  well  as  the  economy,  economic  policy  needs  to  improve  womens  engagement  in  paid  work  by  tackling  2 Killick, T. (May 1999).

Economic growth policies thus need to promote the  social inclusion agenda. In the short term, there is a need to create decent productive employment  opportunities and access to finance for all. This means changing social structures that limit access to  employment, and access to land and other productive resources. It also means establishing social  norms  that  value  women  as  good  with  money,  in  order  to  ensure  access  to  and  control  over  resources they and their households generate.   2.2. Inequality of access and control over resources  While  reducing  absolute  poverty  is  an  important  target,  tackling  relative  poverty,  defined  as  the  percentage of households in a country that earn less than half the median household income in that  country, is equally important. In many countries there are a disproportionate number of minorities,  indigenous peoples, and women among the poor. This income inequality is directly related to their  lower access to and control over resources. Sens 100 million missing women6 is testimony to how  girls are discriminated against in terms of the allocation of household resources to the point that it  creates a gender imbalance in some societies and countries. Willingness to school, feed and provide  health care to girls is strongly determined by income and the costs of providing these services, more  so than for boys. This is related to the low value given to girls and to socially constructed gender  roles  that  place  women  as  mothers  and  carers,  while  men  are  more  valued  as  providers  and  protectors. Womens poverty is caused at community, labor market, and household levels.7 Three  factors  contribute  to  womens  relative  poverty.First,  women  have   fewer  possibilities  to  translate  work  into  income,  stemming  from  (i)  exclusive  responsibility  for  reproductive  work,  (ii)  the  conceptualization  of  their  productive  activities  as  'helping'  men,  and  (iii)  concentration  within  sectors which are either an extension of their reproductive roles (and thus lower paid) and/or within  the informal economy. Second, when women do have an income, they find it difficult to convert this  into  decision  making-capacity.  Perceptions  around  value  of  contribution  to  the  household,  social  norms and self-esteem/relative autonomy influence the capacity to have a voice in decision-making  processes. Finally, when women make decisions, they are less likely to take decisions that improve  their personal wellbeing, and more likely to seek to improve the wellbeing of others. This supposed  altruism, stemming from perceived natural attributes as carers and mothers, is a socially constructed  conceptualization of what it means to be a woman and is exacerbated by womens almost exclusive  responsibility for domestic unpaid work. While investment in infrastructure such as water, sanitation  and electricity is important to ease the time burden associated with these tasks, it does not change  how unpaid work and the care economy is conceptualized and valued. A changed conceptualization  of the valuation of such work should be a longer-term goal. In the short term, policies to provide  affordable,  quality  child  care  and  adequate  health  care  services  would  free  women  to  enter  paid  employment  and  more  importantly  change  care  work  from  being  a  domestic  responsibility  to  a  collective responsibility.   Women  have  been  targeted  by  poverty  reduction  and  social  policy  initiatives.  Many  of  these  initiatives have been shown to be effective, but they dont tackle the underlying socially constructed,  6 Sen, A. (1990). More than 100 million women are missing. New York Review of Books, 37 (20).  7 Bradshaw, S. (2002).

Managau, Nicaragua: Puntos de Encuentro.  9  often irresponsible, behavior of men. Targeting resources towards women is welcome, but where  these are conditional on achieving policy outcomes, such as improving school attendance or infant  nutritional  levels,  the  associated  feminization  of  obligation  and  responsibility8  may  not  only  marginalize men, but also add further to womens existing triple burden of reproductive, productive  and  community  management  work.  It  may  privilege  their  reproductive  over  their  productive  role  and  reinforce  women  as  mothers  rather  than  workers.  While  good  social  services  and  social  protection  programs  are  a  necessity,  these  programs  should  serve  womens  as  well  as  childrens  needs.9 A similar paradigm can be seen with poverty reduction policies directed towards minorities  and  indigenous  peoples.  Rather  than  seeking  to  empower  communities  towards  greater  inclusion  within closed societies, these effectively keep them subjugated as outsiders within a system reliant  on handouts, causing further resentment and exclusion. In the case of all vulnerable groups, policies  directed towards their empowerment are to be welcomed. However their content, approach, and  objectives need to be considered carefully.   2.3. Social Services  While providing quality and affordable health and education services is a key element for eradicating  poverty  and  improving  wellbeing  for  all  people,  investment  in  human  capital  has  been  seen  as  of  particular  importance  for  minorities,  indigenous  peoples,  women,  and  girls.  The  gains  to  be  made  from the investment in services for these groups are individual and collective. For example, if African  countries had closed the gender gap in schooling between 1960 and 1992 as quickly as East Asia did, it  may have produced close to a doubling of per capita income growth in the region.10 Educated women  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  productive  activities  and  enjoy  greater  returns  from  them  than  uneducated women. Similarly minorities and indigenous peoples that are fully immersed in a society  add  to  the  economic  clout  of  that  society  and  increase  the  size  of  the  consumer  base  and  market.  Ensuring  the  education  of  women  is  likely  to  increase  investment  in  the  education  of  their  own  children and is also likely to result in fewer children, easing population pressure. Thus investment in  human capital has positive short and longer-term outcomes and is good for both productivity gains  and population decline. While education is important for economic growth, equality of access to all  levels  of  education  should  be  a  goal  in  itself,  and  education  should  be  used,  not  just  to  improve  productivity,  but  to  promote  social  justice  and  to  challenge  social  norms.  Inequality  of  access  to  secondary and higher education persists, as does limited engagement of girls in the study of science  and technology, limiting the future life and employment options of adolescent girls.    As  one  in  7  girls  gets  married  before  the  age  of  18  in  the  developing  world,  early  and  forced  marriage remains a key issue and an important factor limiting young womens engagement in both  education  and  economic  activities.11  It  occurs  mostly  among  excluded  communities  such  as  minorities and indigenous peoples. Theres a strong link between education and womens ability to  8 Chant, S. (2008). The feminisation of poverty and the feminisation of anti-poverty programmes: Room for revision?

Paid  work  can  also  promote  greater  recognition  of  sexual  and  reproductive  rights  among  women  and  greater  ability  to  make  decisions  about  their  own  fertility.  This  is  important since even when reproductive health services are provided, this is not usually enough to  ensure womens ability to access them. Men often decide if and when to have children, with large  numbers of children still read as a sign of male fertility and power, becoming more important when  masculinity is threatened.12 In many cultures, discussion of sexualities remains taboo, denying access  and  rights  to  those  who  do  not  conform  to  the  heterosexual  norm.  The  sexual  and  reproductive  rights  of  adolescent  girls  in  particular  may  be  overlooked  and  they  may  be  denied  access  to  reproductive health services if they are unmarried.    Womens  groups  and  movements  across  the  globe  continue  to  promote  the  need  to  respect  and  defend  womens  sexual  and  reproductive  rights  and  are  fundamental  to  promoting  these  rights,  though many find themselves under threat for this emphasis. It remains imperative that adequate  reproductive  health  services  are  provided  for  all,  that  there  is  a  formalization  of  sexual  and  reproductive rights as such, and legal protection is provided for those that seek to promote these  contested rights.  2.4. Domestic Legal Frameworks   While human rights have been successful in norm creation, awareness raising, and establishing rights  on the agenda of the international community, the mechanisms have had limited impact on many of  the issues above due to a host of factors, including:    The nature and content of the frameworks created;    The manner in which they have been applied;    The failure to heed the voices of excluded communities, especially women as a group and women  from excluded communities, and;   The hesitation on the part of the chief actors including States and the international community  towards a focus on domestic implementation of international standards.   The  administrative  systems  in  over  70  percent  of  the  worlds  States  derive  from  Western  models,  usually disseminated through colonial practices.13 This has restricted the number and types of models  available and has often established Westernized administrative systems in places far removed from  their  origin.  The  lack  of  technology  and  access  in  the  past  restricted  the  extent  to  which  Southern  models could be studied, adapted, and adopted. Yet many postcolonial societies have struggled hard  against inequalities and social exclusion and have learnt important policy lessons in the process that  need  to  be  disseminated.  This  is  perhaps  most  obvious  in  the  context  of  the  administrative  mechanisms that are being developed and applied in various parts of the world.   12 Bradshaw, S. (2013).

Oxford University  Press.  11  With many States calling for technical co-operation in the field of human rights, it is important that  alternative  models  are  proposed,  always  reserving  a  strong  voice  for  civil  society.14  The  pooling  of  global  administrative  experiences  is  likely  to  yield  results  and  will  give  the  task  of  human  rights  implementation  the  feel  of  a  shared  journey  among  States,  and  between  States,  international  organizations, and civil society. Both international and grassroots human rights groups work through  lobbying  governments  and  keeping  pressure  upon  them  to  fulfill  the  international  human  rights  obligations.  While  such  naming  and  shaming  can  highlight  poor  implementations  and  violations,  it  offers  little  by  way  of  concrete  solutions  and  models  to  address  the  implementation  gap.  The  UN  Human Rights Councils Universal Periodic Review has demonstrated that tools other than naming and  shaming  are  effective  for  greater  recognition  of  rights.  This  may  be  particularly  the  case  in  gender  terms where cultural norms need to be balanced against Western values.   Justice  systems  rarely  meet  the  needs  of  specific  groups  of  women,  and  indigenous  women  and  women  from  other  marginalized  groups  face  particular  discrimination  and  violence.15  Sexual,  emotional, and physical violence and the threat of violence limits womens mobility, confines women  to the home, and keeps them from engaging fully in processes of social and economic development.  Women and girls remain unable to access justice and to use the existing legal standards, given that in  many countries there are still laws that discriminate against women in relation to the family, property,  citizenship and employment. The overt focus on individual rather than collective rights, derived from  Western  origin  laissez-faire  governance  models,  does  not  help  confront  such  social  exclusion  which  needs  instead  collective  solutions  since  the  violations  inevitably  have  a  communitarian  element.  Disconnecting it from this context will allow stronger voices to gain their rights while leaving others  behind.  Reliance  on  advocacy  as  the  sole  tool  available  to  gain  rights  may  result  in  excluded  communities  slipping  further  away  from  social  policy  makers  if  the  only  way  to  gain  their  rights  is  through  expensive  inaccessible  processes.  Legislative  processes  are  also  ineffective  for  most  vulnerable communities whose access is limited by their relative exclusion from political participation  and  weak  access  to  justice.  Some  are  sensitive  to  their  causes  and  try  to  pass  laws  that  seek  to  promote  social  inclusion  and  political  participation.  Against  this  any  focus  on  communitarian  and  collective  rights  needs  to  be  particularly  mindful  of  the  extent  to  which  stronger  voices  within  communities articulate collective positions to the exclusion of other segments of that population. The  impact of this is most visible in the case of women and thus any indicators developed on collective  rights would need to be gender-sensitive.   The  differential  access  to  and  control  over  resources  and  to  social  services,  coupled  with  current  constructions  of  both  the  macro-economic  and  legal  frameworks,  reproduce  rather  than  tackle  structural inequalities that are the root causes of poverty and limit wellbeing. These inequalities may  be further exacerbated by ongoing global trends such as climate change, conflict, and financial crises.   14 Dominguez Redondo, E. (2012).

Global Processes Exacerbating Gender Inequality and Social Exclusion   A long-term perspective to 2030 and beyond needs to address some of the following trends likely to  impact gender equality, social inclusion and human rights.16   Environmental degradation   Ongoing  environmental  degradation  will  have  a  strong  impact  on  the  poor  and  marginalized  populations who are often further away from acceding any potential remedies to such degradation.  Vulnerable populations tend to (i) depend the most on natural environment for their livelihoods, (ii)  live  in  areas  that  are  particularly  prone  to  environmental  degradation;  and  (iii)  are  least  able  to  protect themselves against the effect of environmental degradation. Given their lower asset base,  women farmers may be most affected by climate change, and while having the knowledge, may be  least able to adopt appropriate adaptation strategies.    Conflict over scarce resources   Conflict over scarce resources is likely to become more common and intense as population pressure,  local  environmental  degradation,  and  global  environmental  change  (in  particular  climate  change)  combine to put pressure on vulnerable communities. The resulting fragility is evident in the drylands  where  pastoralist  communities  often  compete  with  sedentary  farmers  over  scarce  water  resources  and  grazing  grounds  and  in  mining  communities.  Post-conflict  and  post-disaster  individual  and  institutionalized  land  grabbing  is  an  important  problem  facing  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  women and girls who may lose their rights to access to and control over land.    Demographic changes and fertility rates  Population growth and fertility rates tend to be highest in poor countries and among poor people,  particularly in rural areas. In addition to living in subsistence conditions, this places inordinately high  burdens on women in particular, curtailing their contribution to every other aspect of community  life  relegating  them  to  second-class  status  within  communities.  Having  large  numbers  of  children  early  in  life  increases  maternal  mortality,  disempowers  women,  lowers  per  capita  investments  in  children, and increases child mortality rates and poor education outcomes.   Voluntary and Forced Migration flows  Human migratory flows will likely grow in volume and involve the movement of men and women, as  well as families. They are likely to become more dispersed with growing numbers of people seeking  refuge in todays emerging countries. Such flows create misery for many migrants, especially women,  leaving them, in situations of isolation and vulnerability. They also put pressure on weaker populations  in  host  countries,  sowing  the  seeds  for  conflict  and  putting  a  downward  pressure  on  wages  and  impacting  labor  markets.  They  also  deprive  the  migrant  countries  of  dynamic  and  relatively  well- educated people (brain drain). The rise of human trafficking results in the degradation of fundamental  human rights, particularly for women and girls.   16 See the SDSNs Framework of Sustainable Development (December 2012) and the Action Agenda for Sustainable  Development (June 2013). Available online at: http://unsdsn.org/resources/  13   Urban growth   It is estimated that around 64 percent of the developing world and 86 percent of the developed will  be urbanized by 2050. Urbanization puts pressure on existing communities and their socio-economic  organization,  creating  new  vulnerabilities  for  women,  children  and  the  aged,  who  often  have  to  manage a households scarce resources or are relegated to work in precarious conditions for wages  below  subsistence  levels.  Uncontrolled  urban  growth  is  also  creating  a  peri-urban  culture  where  people live in unsanitary conditions that pose major health risks and a threat to the environment.  The desertion of rural communities by the youth, leaving only the aged, women and children behind,  poses a great threat to food security and agricultural production in general. Efforts by governments  to provide basic social amenities in rural communities and incentives to reverse or stall the rural- urban drift will be critical to dealing with this challenge.   Corruption  According to the African Union, more than US$148 billion is lost to corruption in Africa every year,  equivalent to 25 percent of Africas GDP.17 Corrupt public officials receive between US$20 and US$40  billion in bribes annually, which is equivalent of 20 to 40 percent of official development assistance.  Further,  based  on  a  study  conducted  in  41  countries,  the  Anti-Corruption  Catalyst  report  finds  that  where  more  bribes  are  paid,  there  is  a  lower  literacy  rate  among  15  to  24-year  olds.18  A  rise  in  reported bribery is also associated with higher maternal deaths in 64 States, regardless of a country's  wealth  or  how  much  it  invests  in  health.  Data  for  51  countries  show  that  people's  access  to  safe  drinking  water  falls  as  bribery  increases.  Such  data  highlight  the  deep  interconnections  in  the  relationship between corruption, human rights, and poverty. Suppression of civil and political rights,  such as access to information, freedom of expression, assembly and freedom of movement, denies  citizens  the  means  to  expose  and  prevent  corruption,  while  the  festering  of  corruption  leads  to  violations of ESC rights. There is therefore the need to curb corruption to provide social capital for the  poor to deal with social exclusion and lack of power to influence their lives.   Armed violence  As voices for democracy have grown, non-democratic regimes such as those in the Middle East and  North Africa have come under increased pressure to change from within their populations. While the  voices  of  protest  need  to  be  understood  and  supported  in  their  legitimate  quest  for  greater  participation and equality, protests in autocratic societies create a precarious environment in which  minorities and women are increasingly threatened. Indicators suggest that such protests are likely to  rise  as  populations  gain  greater  voice  and  seek  to  participate  in  a  robust  manner  to  make  their  communities  fairer.  The  threat  of  violent  responses  to  these  protests  has  grown.  Governments  increasingly view protests with suspicion and seek to quell them in every manner available. Having a  proactive  international  approach  to  securing  lives  and  values  in  the  context  of  such  transitions  is  imperative or the short-term quests towards democracy could undermine the rights of all.   17 African Union.

During  the  recent  financial  crisis,  measures  to  protect  the  poor  through employment programs have not considered the gendered dimensions of crisis. Yet women  may have been more severely affected than men and in more diverse ways. Women face particular  risks during conflict and disaster, and climate change may increase these risks. In particular, the risk  of physical and sexual violence may increase. Agencies not only fail to protect women and girls but  their  reproductive  and  their  productive  needs  are  often  overlooked  in  crisis  response  and  peace- building.     4. Pathways toward sustainable development  While the global processes described in the previous section suggest a bleak future, the post-2015  process represents a real opportunity to make policy-oriented decisions that address these issues.  There  are  positive  lessons  to  be  learned  from  those  already  seeking  to  overcome  these  obstacles  and potential solutions to what seem to be insurmountable problems may lie in these small scale  and local initiatives.   Physical security  The  right  to  physical  security  is  a  fundamental  human  right  without  which  any  economic  growth  gains,  improved  incomes,  and  services  provided  would  be  meaningless.  In  recent  years,  large  magnitude  natural  disasters  have  impacted  the  lives  of  many,  leaving  death,  disability  and  destruction in their wake. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti demonstrated how the lack of development  could  make  populations  more  vulnerable  and  less  able  to  recover.  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Sandy  highlighted  that  even  developed  nations  are  not  immune  and  that  minority  and  indigenous  communities are often disproportionately affected. Across the globe, many live in insecurity, in fear  of  violent  attacks  or  going  about  their  daily  lives  under  siege.  The  line  between  combatant  and  civilian has become blurred, making the ability to ensure physical security increasingly difficult. Some  recent international humanitarian interventions have shown that those that aim to protect may now  be as much targets as welcome providers of relief. Much like health has been constructed around  illness rather than wellbeing, the global focus has been on conflict or disaster rather than human  security.  There  is  need  to  change  this  conceptualization  if  the  right  to  physical  security  is  to  be  attained. At present, there is a separation between humanitarian actors who provide relief during  and immediately after an event and development actors who enter later once peace is established  or  normal  services  resumed.  The  UKs  Department  for  International  Developments  (DFID)  recent  call to embed humanitarian actions into development and to disaster-proof development is a step  forward in this context, especially when linked with its recent work on understanding conflict and  disaster  as  gendered  experiences.19  Changing  conceptualizations  of  physical  security  need  to  recognize that, for instance, the threat to women in situations of unrest and conflict is as much from  sexual  as  physical  violence  and  violence  post-disaster  may  pose  as  great  a  hazard  as  the  natural  event itself.   19 UK Department for International Development. (2011). Humanitarian Emergency Response Review. London, UK: DFID.  Available online at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/67579/HERR.pdf  15   Eradication of Gender-Based Violence  Gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread and undermines human rights by (i) directly hindering  the enjoyment of rights by the victims, (ii) failing to support equality in all aspects of life, and (iii)  creating  a  culture  of  fear  and  domination  that  significantly  undermines  the  ability  of  girls  and  women  to  play  a  full  and  equal  role  within  society.  While  the  right  to  live  free  from  violence  is  fundamental,  tackling  such  violence  is  hindered  by  deep-rooted  cultural  traditions.  Upholding  womens rights challenges patriarchal norms that accept male violence against women as normal.  The  characterization  of  such  violence  as  domestic  violence  further  constructs  it  as  a  private,  not  public matter, and therefore somehow outside jurisdiction.    Many countries are working to improve the rate of reporting of gender-based crimes and increase  convictions  through  integrated  and  specialized  services  to  address  womens  access  to  justice  and  more efficient handling of gender-related crimes. These include reforming services at police stations  and  courts  to  ensure  survivors  are  treated  with  respect,  as  well  as  protocols  for  collecting  and  collating  evidence,  and  the  sensitive  handling  of  the  survivors  of  sexual  violence  and  abuse.  The  more successful programs employ specially trained individuals who guide clients through the entire  process,  including  medical  treatment,  reporting,  bringing  a  claim  in  court,  and  assisting  in  prosecutions.  Although  such  programs  can  help  all  women,  they  are  particularly  important  for  women living in poverty, who face more daunting obstacles in accessing justice.    One solution is such a one-stop approach to reporting on GBV: increasing the rates of convictions  and  creating  a  nuanced  understanding  of  the  specific  needs  of  women  in  accessing  the  justice  system. In Brazil, the Delegacias Especiais de Atendimento  Mulher are womens police stations.20  Operating  across  420  local  jurisdictions,  they  provide  immediate  assistance  to  survivors  of  sexual  violence,  undertake  enquiries,  and  steer  cases  through  Brazils  otherwise  complicated  criminal  justice  system.  The  proliferation  of  these  womens  police  stations  has  been  credited  with  raising  awareness of violence against women, increasing the reporting of GBV and creating a high visibility  bulwark  against  the  prevalence  of  GBV.  In  South  Africa,21  the  Sexual  Offences  Courts  and  the  Thuthuzela  Centres22  have  streamlined  the  handling  and  prosecution  of  cases  of  sexual  abuse  through  the  instigation  of  integrated  investigatory  processes,  the  dispensation  of  the  necessary  health care, and the provision of counseling, legal, and police services. This program sends a clear  message in terms of societal values and has already increased conviction rates. It has also reduced  the average duration of proceedings to six months, where it would previously take between three  and five years. The advantage of having women at the focal point is also in itself empowering and  provides greater efficacy to the process of gaining rights for all.    Legal  and  judicial  changes  could  form  catalysts  for  change  in  eliminating  gender-based  violence.  However  for  far-reaching,  lasting  change  to  be  achieved,  these  need  to  be  reinforced  with  campaigns such as the White Ribbon Campaign (USA) and the Man Up Campaign (Guyana).

So-called  edutainment  programming  that  injects  social  messages  into  TV  and  radio  soaps  have  proved  popular  and  powerful means of changing understandings of violence in countries as diverse as Nicaragua (Puntos  de  Encuentro/Sexto  Sentido),  where  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  law  protecting  women  from  violence  was  increased  through  the  program,  and  in  South  Africa  (Soul  City),  where  the  depiction of people beating pots and pans outside a neighbors house when the man was beating his  wife proved a particularly inspirational depiction. Such programming, while costly to make, reaches  wide  audiences,  with  a  range  of  messages.  23  Such  programs  provoke  discussion,  influence  social  convergence  around  societal  norms,  and  depict  actions  that  individuals  can  take  to  improve  wellbeing and claim their rights.  Guaranteeing Legal identity  Social  exclusion  often  occurs  because  vulnerable  communities  are  beyond  the  reach  of  existing  administrative  mechanisms,  commencing  from  a  failure  of  registration  at  birth.  Bereft  of  registration, individuals and swathes of communities are left in a void, unable to access available  rights,  and  not  reflected  within  the  statistics  for  that  society.  While  many  international  agencies  have  sought  to  focus  on  the  registration  of  the  birth  of  every  child,  this  call  has  often  been  less  heeded by national authorities, and not monitored closely by international bodies. Yet in order to  tackle  social  exclusion,  this  is  a  vital  step  without  which  another  generation  could  be  excluded.  Concerted  efforts  are  required  to  understand  the  barriers  to  registration  and  to  understand  the  broad  geographic  element  to  failures  of  registration.  Among  those  who  experience  failures  of  registration  are  the  most  vulnerable  excluded  groups:  ethnic  minorities,  indigenous  peoples,  stateless communities, persons with disabilities, and undocumented migrants. Particular attention  needs to be paid to gender within excluded communities, since lack of registration of the girl child is  often  linked  to  the  perception  of  her  limited  value  to  the  family  and  society.  The  antidote  to  registration  failures  lies  in  making  such  processes  free,  simple  to  access  and  understand,  and  available at the most local of levels. The success of registration processes can be gauged by whether  they  provide  multiple  registration  avenues  and  by  the  cost  of  such  processes.  Technological  improvements could yield mobile registration units, door-to-door outreach programs, integration of  registration  services  in  hospitals,  reproductive  health  services,  vaccination  programs,  local  stores  and banks. Cambodia has seen a dramatic improvement in mass registration through such processes  thanks to a partnership between the Government and international actors which resulted in a mass  mobile registration campaign, bringing 12 million unregistered people within the fold from 2005 to  2008. Data from Plan International highlights the variety of measures used, details the reforms that  were made to the registration law, and explains the community awareness campaign that enabled  full  access  by  ensuring  a  large  volume  of  volunteers  who  were  mobilized  to  engage  in  the  mass  campaign.24     Enabling Access to and Control over Resources   Across  the  globe,  women  earn  less  over  their  lifetime  than  men  for  comparable  employment.

Women are disproportionately represented in agriculture  and in the informal sector, where they often work under conditions that trap them in low levels of  productivity. Two major constraints that maintain this status quo are the lack of access to land and  credit for women, minorities, and indigenous peoples. While the spread of micro-credit programs  has begun to address womens lack of capital, these have not been targeted towards minorities and  indigenous peoples to the same degree. Women and minorities, including minority women, remain  land-poor. In the case of indigenous peoples, traditional claims to territory have been overturned  and  fundamental  questions  remain  around  as  to  how  traditional  ownership  over  lands  and  its  resources can be recognized.    Although  no  reliable  figures  exist,  it  is  estimated  that  land  ownership  by  women  is  less  than  10  percent  worldwide,  while  50  percent  of  the  total  workload  in  planting  and  in  care  for  domestic  animals is carried out by women in Sub-Saharan Africa.25 Reasons for low ownership of land among  women  vary.  Rights  to  land  and  property  are  a  complex  issue  and  simply  issuing  titles  does  not  change  the  underlying  social  factors  that  determine  who  is  seen  to  have  the  right  to  it.  Property  ownership  is  often  considered  to  be  a  relationship  between  people  and  things,  but  property  relations  actually  signify  a  relationship  between  people  and  people.  Claims  to  use  and  dispose  of  land arise from social relations and they can be built through fulfillment of social obligations of, for  example,  a  wife  to  her  husband  or  other  relatives.  Often  obligations  are  related  to  whether  the  person is seen as able to farm the land, with social norms effectively negating womens access. The  need for women to have male protection means that even when she can own land herself, she will  give land to brothers or husbands to ensure this. In the indigenous context, traditional claims, often  undocumented, clash with land tenure systems and registration processes that arrived with colonial  rule or settlers and often misappropriated indigenous lands through subterfuge. With multinational  companies, especially in the mining sector, keen to gain licenses to explore in such territories, many  clashes are emerging. In response, the post-2015 framework should endorse the principle of free  prior informed consent for all decisions pertaining to indigenous territories.    Ultimately,  to  bring  change  in  land  tenure  systems  and  make  them  more  inclusive,  fundamental  changes may be required to determinations of ownership. Many countries still restrict ownership of  property to men. Some land registration policies assign ownership to a male household head and  inheritance  norms  favor  the  traditional  practice  where  land  is  passed  down  to  sons.  Some  governments  have  begun  to  recognize  the  need  for  proactive  intervention  in  order  to  change  womens continued exclusion from land ownership. In Ethiopia the government has distributed over  20 million land use certificates, requiring that land needs to be held jointly by husbands and wives,  which  promises  an  improvement  towards  the  empowerment  of  women,  paired  with  increases  in  land-related  investments.  Comparative  analysis  from  Honduras  and  Nicaragua  support  this  and  a  positive  correlation  can  be  found  between  womens  property  rights  and  their  overall  role  in  the  household economy, facilitating greater control over agricultural income, higher shares of business  and labor market earnings, and more frequent receipt of credit.26 Other studies suggest that young  women understand the importance of land holding. A study in Mexico found that young unmarried  25 Gler von Ravensburg, N. and Jacobsen, I. (December 1999). Gender Responsive Land Tenure Development. Germany:  GTZ.

Paper prepared for USAID/ BASIS CRSP. Madison, Wisconsin.  18  female  wage  earners  looked  to  buy  land  as  an  investment  for  the  future,  knowing  that  such  a  purchase  would  improve  their  bargaining  power  in  marriage.27  In  the  final  analysis  the  post-2015  agenda needs to adopt a robust approach in combatting social norms that deny marginalized groups  access to land.   Providing Access to Decent Work and Livelihoods   Employment  generation  is  a  key  component  of  any  development  model,  but  in  order  for  such  a  model to be just, the employment needs to obey minimum core labor standard thresholds including  non-discrimination, absence of forced and child labor, and the freedom of association and collective  bargaining.  In  addition,  it  must  offer  fair  wages  and  decent  working  conditions.  Labor  rights  have  been  severely  jeopardized  in  a  globalized  labor  market  where  firms  compete  for  cheap  labor  and  where unions and workers rights are considered an obstacle imposing undue cost. Workers within  the  informal  sectors  often  lack  basic  labor  rights  and  work  under  conditions  that  violate  basic  standards governing decent work. While the informal sector is problematic in terms of the lack of  safeguards,  it  can  provide  the  only  means  of  survival  for  many  households,  and  for  some  commentators, it is the real engine of growth that will spawn the future entrepreneurs. The lack of  rights enjoyed by many workers in the formal sector also means there has been a blurring of the  distinction  as  the  formal  becomes  more  informal  through  outsourcing.  Much  of  this  work  is  undertaken  by  women  in  their  homes,  but  young  women  are  also  a  favored  workforce.  This  is  especially  true  in  textiles  and  electronics  factories  where  womens  perceived  natural  ability  to  undertake detailed repetitive work, maintain high productivity over long hours, and command low  wages make them an obvious choice. The inclusion of women in the labor force, albeit in part time,  menial, poorly paid, and low status jobs, contrasts with the rise in male unemployment and under  employment.  This  erosion  of  the  male  provider/protector  role  in  part  explains  the  crisis  in  masculinity  documented  in  the  academic  literature.28  Such  crises  can  cause  a  backlash  against  women, as men sometimes reassert their power in the private sphere through violence. Young men  in  particular  may  suffer  such  crises,  resulting  in  overt  displays  of  maleness  especially  where  unemployment  is  high  and  male  educational  attainment  is  lower  than  for  girls.  There  is  then  the  need for a concerted effort to ensure jobs for young women and men. These jobs need to be decent  and dignified and reflect the fact women and men may need and want to dedicate time to raising a  family, especially when their children are young.    Trade  unions  remain  the  most  effective  mechanism  for  ensuring  just  wages  and  decent  working  conditions.  In  recent  years,  new  types  of  unions  have  sprung  up,  in  particular  among  women  workers, that take account of the diverse range of dependencies among workers. For example, the  Self-Employed Womens Association in India represents informal sector workers who work on their  own account and in sub-contracting arrangements. This union of the self-employed demands labor  rights for its members, while at the same time organizing access to credit, childcare, and insurance.  The Federacin Nacional de Trabajadoras del Hogar de Bolivia offers a similar example. Drawing on  legal  provisions  in  CEDAW,  this  union  of  domestic  workers  has  successfully  achieved  legislation  giving domestic workers basic rights. It is now working to assure that its members can access their  27 Deere, C. D. and Len, M. (2001). Empowering Women: Land and Property rights in Latin America.

Oxford, UK: Oxfam Publishing.  19  rights.  These  new  types  of  unions  contribute  importantly  to  making  development  socially  sustainable.   Ensuring Access to Public Services   An overt focus of the future Sustainable must be on the eradication of extreme poverty, which is a  human rights violation in itself and is the primary obstacle to the enjoyment of all other rights in  many societies. Social protection mechanisms such as cash transfer schemes, public work programs,  school  stipends,  social  pensions,  food  vouchers  and  food  transfers,  and  user  fee  exemptions  for  health  care  and  education  established  in  the  most  impoverished  and  unequal  societies  have  demonstrated how persistent inequality can be mitigated. These experiences make a strong case for  embedding broad-based social protection systems in national social policies, as already visible in the  Productive  Safety  Net  Programme  (Ethiopia),  the  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Scheme  (India),  the  Challenging  the  Frontiers  of  Poverty  Reduction  (Bangladesh),  and  the Pilot Social Cash Transfer Scheme (Kalomo District, Zambia).    School  meal  programs  in  India,  Brazil  and  Paraguay,  and  the  distribution  of  food  baskets  have  played an important role in reducing the prevalence of hunger. Social protection programs have also  contributed to the realization of the right to education, allowing families to absorb costs associated  with  schooling  through  school  feeding  initiatives  that  provide  fee  waivers  and  subsidies  as  best  demonstrated  through  the  Oportunidades  program  in  Mexico.  Several  studies  demonstrate  the  contribution  of  such  investments  to  increasing  school  enrolment  rates,  number  of  accumulated  education years, and peer pressure that encourages non-beneficiary families to send their children  to school.    There  is  strong  evidence  collected  through  the  offices  of  the  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  Extreme  Poverty  focused  on  Latin  America  to  indicate  that  greater  family  access  to  risk  management  instruments  (unemployment  benefits,  disability  benefits,  etc.)  directly  reduces  the  prevalence  of  child labor. In the context of health, such transfers have increased the regularity of medical check- ups, reduced child mortality, improved prospects for immunization, and reduced regular illness and  deaths.  The  Peruvian  cash  transfer  program  Juntos  has  had  a  particularly  salutary  effect  on  maternal health, reporting an increase of 65% in prenatal and postnatal visits to health clinics and a  reduction of home births in an area that previously showed high levels of maternal mortality.    In  many  instances,  women  have  been  targeted  as  the  beneficiaries  of  these  programs  -  the  assumption  being  that  they  are  responsible  for  taking  young  children  for  health  checks,  ensuring  their  health  and  wellbeing,  and  making  sure  children  attend  school.  Care  needs  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  such  programs  do  not  reinforce  gender  stereotypes  around  womens  carer  roles,  marginalizing men and their role in the unpaid economy. Not all programs have been gendered in  the  way  Opportunidades  is,  offering  greater  financial  incentives  to  families  to  send  girls  to  secondary school. Where conditions do apply to transfers, these should specifically target girls and  particularly  the  secondary  education  of  girls.  Another  such  program,  the  Bangladesh  Female  Secondary  School  Programme,  not  only  paid  school  fees  but  also  offered  a  financial  incentive  directly to the girls. Payment was conditional on a number of factors, including on young women  remaining unmarried until the age of 18. While the aim of limiting early marriage is a laudable, the  conditions  may  not  be  compatible  with  a  rights  approach  and  due  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  20  bringing real, not imposed change. Some programs have provided adult women with resources such  as  pre  and  postnatal  care.  Limiting  services  to  maternal  health  does  not  provide  access  to  reproductive health services and does not actively promote womens reproductive health rights to  decide the timing and spacing of children or their sexual rights to enjoy a healthy sex life. There is  then  still  a  need  to  promote  programs  that  focus  on  womens  needs  and  provide  services  for  women, as rights, not as an add on to other programs.     The impact of social protection programs varies depending on their objectives, design, and level of  institutionalization. The level of development of the countries where they are implemented is also a  significant factor. The need for conditions is another factor that has been debated in ethical as well  as practical terms, and the utility of making payments conditional on schooling or health outcomes  is  itself  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors.  Yet  whatever  the  criticisms,  there  is  no  denying  that  these  systems  reduce  the  prevalence  and  severity  of  poverty,  improve  social  cohesion,  reduce  inequality, and have the potential to contribute towards the creation of sustainable and equitable  societies.  Transferring  resources  to  those  in  extreme  poverty  allows  beneficiaries  to  generate  income, protect their assets, and accumulate human capital. Even in OECD countries, it is estimated  that  levels  of  poverty  and  inequality  are  approximately  half  those  that  might  be  expected  in  the  absence  of  social  protection.  The  idea  of  social  protection  has  also  gained  increasing  political  support  in  the  development  and  poverty  reduction  discourse.  The  idea  of  non-contributory  minimum  social  protection  crystallized  in  2009,  when  the  Heads  of  United  Nations  Agencies  launched the Social Protection Floor Initiative as one of nine joint initiatives to cope with the global  economic and financial crises. It has since received support at the UN Millennium Summit (2010) in  the G20s Cannes Summit Final Declaration (2011) and in the form of ILO Recommendation No. 202  (2012).29   Guaranteeing Access to Information   Technological  change  offers  new  opportunities  for  delivering  social  services  and  income  opportunities  for  the  poor.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  endangering  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  individuals,  particularly  women  and  low-paid  workers  as  it  changes  the  nature  of  their  jobs,  increases a skill premium, and promotes the winner takes all effect. As a result, inequalities within  countries are likely to rise unless counteracted by active policies. Any developmental policy that is  sensitive to the needs of social inclusion has to include a focus on technology, since it tends to be  harnessed  and  used  to  the  exclusion  of  marginalized,  excluded,  and  vulnerable  communities.  A  concerted  policy  focusing  on  women  and  technology  is  required  to  ensure  that  women  are  the  beneficiaries of technology, as well as able to contribute to its development and dissemination.   The articulation of rights frameworks tends to place little emphasis on accessibility to information,  especially legal information. For a system that still relies heavily on legal advocates claiming rights  from recalcitrant governments, the lack of information flows concerning rights and remedies harms  the  prospect  of  the  poorest  communities  gaining  redress.  Mainstreaming  rights  education  and  disseminating  it  through  a  variety  of  means,  including  through  adult  learning,  is  crucial  for  the  empowerment  of  excluded  communities.  Legal  and  other  materials  elaborating  human  rights  are  29 Social Protection Floor Advisory Group. (2011). Social Protection Floor for a Fair and Inclusive Globalization. Geneva,  Switzerland: International Labour Organization. Available online at:  http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_165750/lang--en/index.htm  21  often  written  in  complex  formats  using  legal  language  that  excludes  accessibility  by  the  most  vulnerable  populations.  The  SDG  framework  should  encourage  countries  to  simplify  and  translate  materials  such  as  constitutional  rights  and  explanations  of  basic  civic  and  administrative  systems  into  local  languages  to  ensure  that  they  are  available  and  comprehensible  to  those  that  need  it  most.  It  is  also  imperative  that  public  services  incorporate  mechanisms  for  advice  and  complaint  using  multiple  communication  channels  so  as  not  to  leave  individuals  vulnerable  to  powerful  administrators and to overcome problems concerning literacy. Special attention needs to be paid to  the extent to which any facilities developed are accessible by women.   Facilitating Access to Justice   Many  societies  have  worked  to  provide  paralegal  services  to  the  most  vulnerable  groups.  Being  educated to a basic level and located close to communities, paralegals have played an essential role  in providing administrative remedies that would be too costly otherwise. Paralegals reduce reliance  on  free  legal  aid,  leaving  such  aid  for  use  in  the  most  egregious  violations  of  human  rights.  The  equipping of paralegals with skills concerning the laws in operation and on counseling could assist  socially excluded communities in accessing processes that would otherwise be unfamiliar to them.  In  addition,  they  make  the  legal  system  more  efficient,  eradicating  the  matters  that  can  be  addressed more swiftly from the overburdened justice system. In this way, they increase efficiency,  reduce caseloads, divert untenable claims away from the courts, and improve the effectiveness of  judicial  and  police  procedures  by  holding  officials  to  account.  Paralegals  could  also  contribute  to  educating  communities  about  their  rights  and  making  them  aware  of  the  range  of  remedies  available to them. The 2012 Kampala Declaration on Community Paralegals supported by over 50  African  organizations  and  over  20  countries  is  testimony  to  the  importance  given  to  this  issue  in  Africa.30 The Declaration urges governments to strengthen access to justice across the continent and  frames community paralegals as having an important role. These principles have already been put in  place  and  applied  in  diverse  societies.  In  Kenya,  the  Centre  for  Legal  Empowerment  (Kituo  cha  Sheria) implements a paralegal project in the Shimo la Tewa prison specifically fulfilling a gap left by  the states legal aid system.31 The organization has trained 95 paralegals including 11 wardens, 10  persons  on  remand  and  51  convicts.  It  has  drafted  over  400  applications  and  letters  to  Chief  Magistrates and a significant volume of applications and appeals before High Courts in Malindi and  Mombasa. The high success rate of these petitions has made the work of Kituo cha Sheria worthy of  replicating in other settings. The organizations high profile victory for prisoners right to vote in a  2010 landmark case has focused attention on this relatively ignored group. The Paralegal Advisory  Service  in  Malawi  operates  in  a  similar  manner  in  a  country  where  less  than  20  lawyers  serve  a  population  of  more  than  14  million.  The  service  trains  individuals  in  criminal  law  and  procedure,  interviewing  skills,  and  information  management,  and  the  paralegals  then  provide  legal  advice,  training  and  coordination  between  different  justice  agencies.  The  service  has  achieved  84%  coverage of the prison population and has had dramatic effects in reducing the remand (under-trial)  prison  population.32  A  similar  venture  in  Sierra  Leone  run  by  the  NGO  Timap  for  Justice  (literally,  Stand Up for Justice), commenced in 2003 has had a similar impact in pioneering community-based  30 Available at: http://www.namati.org/news/newsfeed/kampala-declaration/  31 For more information, see the Kituo cha Sheria website at: http://www.kituochasheria.or.ke/  32 Penal Reform International & the Bluhm Legal Clinic of the Northwestern University School of Law.

Timaps work is supported by  lawyers  who  engage  customary  litigation  mechanisms  for  redress  of  intractable  legal  issues;  a  capacity  which  provides  greater  efficacy  to  the  work  of  the  paralegals.33  The  impact  of  the  organization can be seen in governmental recognition for the need to develop a national paralegal  program based on the organizations work34, and has also been validated by the World Bank who  found strong evidence of empowerment in Timaps work.35    Increasing Public Participation and Involvement in Decision Making   The  lack  of  effective  political  participation  is  a  key  reason  why  inequality  and  subordination  are  perpetuated  for  women,  minorities,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Women  and  minorities  often  participate  extensively  in  grassroots  activism  but  formal  politics  is  often  beyond  the  reach  of  the  marginalized and vulnerable. As a result, issues germane to their progress receive scant attention.  Various forms of quotas have had some impact on the formal political participation of women and  minorities. More than one hundred countries today have either party quotas, legislative quotas, or  reserved  seats  for  women  in  parliaments.  Quota  requirements  are  proliferating  with  regard  to  corporate  boards  where  womens  absence  has  been  particularly  noted.  Countries  that  have  implemented quotas have often seen a significant jump in the presence of women and minorities in  formal politics. In Rwanda, a gender quota instituted in the aftermath of the genocide has led to the  highest rate of women in parliament in the world. India also has long standing quotas for minorities  (scheduled  castes  and  tribes)  and  introduced  gender  quotas  in  local  government  through  a  constitutional  amendment  in  1993,  with  demonstrated  effects  on  establishing  women  as  leaders.  While it is important  to  place  women in parliamentary seats, it is clearly not enough to ensure  a  gender  perspective    since  a  womans  key  identity  may  be  to  her  caste,  class,  ethnic  group  or  religion, rather than to other women Even when female parliamentarians promote gender issues,  deep-seated  discriminatory  practices  and  patriarchal  norms  are  difficult  to  change  through  top- down measures alone.    The involvement of women in informal political activities such as social movements and grassroots  organizations  may  be  a  key  for  change.  Women  can  not  only  be  involved  but  also  can  shape  the  nature of that activism and have a real impact. Many examples exist of women lobbying for change,  including  changes  to  laws  on  violence  against  women,  conditions  of  work,  and  other  injustices.  Womens voices may be more easily heard in the all-women spaces of the womens movements and  they have been effective lobbyists on the international stage.    Yet  while  increasingly  heard  on  the  international  stage,  womens  voices  remain  quiet  in  the  domestic realm, and even when they earn an income, women struggle to turn income into voice.  Households  are  not  always  sites  of  solidarity  but  can  be  sites  of  inequality  that  produce  and  reproduce  gender  inequalities  of  power.  Although  governments  seek  to  regulate  how  people  live  and  who  they  live  with,  they  seem  unwilling  to  engage  with  household  dynamics.  Most  policies  avoid dealing with mens bad behavior in the household. In order to promote change, there is a  33 McCourt , K. (2009).

To achieve gender equality demands joined up initiatives  linking economic and sexual reproductive rights, ensuring women are able to make decisions in the  economic and intimate realms. The popular feminist magazine La Boletina in Nicaragua publishes  articles  written  in  a  style  that  a  woman  with  primary  education  can  understand  around  topical  economic,  legal,  political,  and  sexual  and  reproductive  issues.  It  seeks  to  inform  and  educate,  including reporting on laws and changes to laws, aims to promote women at the grassroots to claim  their rights, and seeks to mobilize women during elections to use their votes.   An important mechanism to achieve womens political participation is their mobilization at election  time and their inclusion in peacebuilding. For example, the Womens Platform for Peaceful Elections  in Senegal was constituted at the beginning of 2012 to respond to the rising tensions and political  violence  witnessed  ahead  of  the  presidential  elections.  Arising  from  the  a  meeting  of  the  African  women of the 55 organizations constituting the Gender Is My Agenda Campaign (GIMAC), Femmes  Africa  Solidarit  (FAS),  which  coordinates  the  network,  set  up  a  task  force  for  early  warning  and  early response, composed of Senegalese womens organizations, partner international organizations  and  women  leaders  from  neighboring  countries  to  launch  a  strong  initiative  of  women  for  peace  before, during and after the Presidential Elections in Senegal. It is common in societies in transition  to  enlist  foreign  observers  who  can  guarantee  the  free  and  fair  nature  of  elections.  However  the  Womens Platform for Peaceful Elections conducted this role itself by getting trained women to act  as  observers  across  13  regions  of  Senegal.  The  capacity  building  also  tackled  journalists  who,  alongside  observers,  could  report  on  any  incidents  of  violence  or  intimidation,  and  could  collect  gender-sensitive  information  on  the  elections.  In  keeping  with  the  need  to  spread  such  good  practice through the available technology, the Platform has also encompassed the establishment of  an online platform of the Community of Practice on conflict prevention, creating Pan African access  to these issues. As a way to enhance the promotion of gender equality and womens empowerment,  they also established a Situation Room: a non-partisan space where women work together to foster  peaceful co-existence, ensuring media messages on gender, peace and security during and after the  electoral process, advocating for free, fair, peaceful and transparent elections, and encouraging the  active participation of women in democratic processes in Africa. The Situation Room acted as a hub  for coordination and command for the entire electoral process, including providing detailed analyses  of the processes and identifying the need for real time reaction. The impact of such a movement has  been  significant  in  bringing  womens  voices  to  the  negotiating  table  at  important  transitional  moments as is worthy of replication across the world.    Valuing Social Cohesion and Diversity  Inequalities  are  at  the  basis  of  social  exclusion.  To  ensure  an  inclusive  society  involves  actively  working to provide marginalized individuals with the opportunities to improve their wellbeing and  voice,  and  to  ensure  the  collective  rights  of  groups  who  have  been  discriminated  against.  Many  developing  countries  have  worked  on  unpicking  persistent  inequalities,  usually  through  the  Constitution.  For  example,  China  has  sought  to  create  administrative  mechanisms  to  enable  the  ascent from poverty for millions of communities through a series of affirmative action and policy  changes  in  education,  political  governance,  and  linguistic  rights.  Through  affirmative  action  measures  embedded  in  administrative  laws  that  stem  from  basic  constitutional  guarantees  of  equality,  India  has  sought  to  challenge  culturally-ingrained  inequalities  underpinning  caste-based  24  discrimination.  New  Zealand  has  worked  to  establish  processes  undoing  historical  violations  that  placed  the  Maori  in  a  subjugated  position  to  the  Parekha  (settlers)  and  institute  remedies  that  challenge  inequalities.  Lebanon  has  attempted  to  create  administrative  processes  to  calibrate  Christian  and  Muslim  influences  through  consociationalism  (a  form  of  power  sharing),  while  underscoring the need for such divisions to disappear over time. Iraq, emerging from the shadow of  oppression  and  conflict,  has  sought  to  create  mechanisms  to  accommodate  Kurdish  ambitions.  African states such as Uganda and Kenya are engaged in detailed discussions concerning the efficacy  of land tenure systems, and South Africa has demonstrated that socio-economic rights can be made  justiciable  through,  for  example,  access  to  anti-retroviral  drugs.  Colombia  has  led  the  way  in  recognizing  indigenous  rights  with  echoes  in  Mexico  and  Bolivia,  while  Brazil  has  sought  mechanisms to put the Bolsa Familia scheme on a firm legal footing. All these mechanisms ought to  be  studied  and,  where  suitable  and  culturally  appropriate,  ought  to  be  solutions  to  enable  more  inclusive societies.    Engaging Other Key Actors  Traditional  donors  have  a  role  to  play  in  the  post-2015  agenda,  including  providing  financing  for  development, but new countries are becoming donorswhile other options need to be explored.  States need to take responsibility for their own social development. One interesting example of an  effort  to  re-embed  macroeconomics  into  social  policy  are  gender  budgets.  NGOs  in  the  UK  and  South  Africa  have  generated  budgets  which  analyze  public  expenditures  and  how  these  are  distributed, keeping in view the needs of poor households and taking into consideration unpaid care  work.  They  recognize  that  different  people  have  different  needs  in  different  contexts  and  assess  whether  public  budgets  are  structured  adequately  to  meet  such  differential  needs.  They  also  consider the ways in which governments raise public revenue.    The private sector also has a role in financing development. However, while public-private partnership  models have become popular service delivery options, this remains a need rather than rights-based  approach to social service and public sector provision. The challenge is to ensure a rights approach  from a profit led private sector. The growing importance of the private sector will challenge traditional  models  of  State-led  human  rights  instruments,  as  governments  will  need  to  negotiate  policies  with  business, civil society, and other stakeholders. It is important to maintain that States are the principal  duty bearers and remain the main providers or facilitators of the payment of remedies. The dangers of  privatizing some elements of basic provision is that they may then be driven solely by market forces  and  fail  to  provide  basic  remedies  required  to  those  in  vulnerable  communities.  Nonetheless  there  remains  a  significant  role  for  the  private  sector,  as  critical  bearers  of  duties  to  respect  and  foster  human rights in their own policies and practices, in creating mechanisms to consult and engage with  local communities, and in seeking to assist in the creation of robust mechanism that are human rights  friendly. It is important that emphasis is moved from the creation of non-binding rules like corporate  social  responsibility  to  binding  norms  to  regulate  and  control  corporate  activities,  particularly  in  addressing  issues  of  gender  imbalance  through  the  provision  of  decent  and  worthwhile  work  for  women and men in the communities in which they operate.   While public-private partnerships may provide useful access to legal mechanisms for rights fulfillment,  they  could  not  replace  the  need  to  lobby  for  rights  to  be  recognized  through  administrative  rather  than  judicial  channels  for  marginalized  communities.  Organized  civil  society  has  a  key  role  to  play  25  here. Similarly, while the market is a way that citizens can object to activities of private enterprises  and institutions that are seen to violate rights, mass mobilization via consumer and social movements  are not only more effective but bring the added bonus of improving social cohesion and democratic  voice. Grassroots organizations and social movements need to be supported and their capacity built,  through sharing of experience across and within national boundaries.    Civil society inputs remains crucial in ensuring that marginalized groups have a voice in the articulation  of development policies post-2015. As news networks have become decentralized and as information  flows  have  become  less  regulated  due  to  advances  in  technology,  it  is  now  possible  to  hear  more  voices. In recent decades there has been increasing importance placed on listening to these voices and  has resulted in significant improvements in the direction of policy as a wider range of stakeholders can  bring influence to bear on policy making. As the risks of exclusion of marginalized communities grow,  it  is  imperative  that  the  mechanisms  of  the  future  provide  adequate  opportunities  for  civil  society  actors to engage with emerging processes.    Measuring Social Inclusion and Access to Rights   Development  measures  have  become  significantly  more  holistic  over  recent  years,  moving  away  from narrow definitions of income poverty to wider notions of wellbeing. This ought to be advanced  in the post-2015 agenda, specifically in ensuring that new measures, such as those that reach inside  the household, are reflected in data. By comparison, human rights metrics have been negligent in  creating  accurate  diagnostic  tools.  As  a  result,  criticism  of  human  rights  performance  is  often  rhetorical and single dimensional. There is a need to develop a human rights index  as a diagnostic  tool  to  enable  adequate  comparison  of  human  rights  within  States,  while  catering  for  other  competing imperatives such as the opportunity cost of investing in health or other welfare. Such an  index would show how technical support and policy change could have significant impact on human  rights, gender parity, and social inclusion within each country.      Conclusion  Stripped to basic principles, the social inclusion agenda to 2030 and beyond ought to be focused on  guaranteeing  fundamental  equalities,  and  not  merely  on  achieving  minimal  thresholds  of  non- discrimination. While the framing of certain socio-economic rights may contain norms of progressive  realization, the duty of non-discrimination as a recognized fundamental norm of law is not subject  to such caveats. It requires that systems treat everyone the same and is only justifiable when each  individual or community starts from the same premise of equal access to opportunities and equal  needs. But treating those who are different as the same perpetrates new inequalities undermining  the human rights project.    This report has emphasized the need to ensure a rights rather than service-led agenda, placing de  facto equality at the heart of the global sustainable development planning agenda. The SDGs must  affirm the need to achieve gender equality, social inclusion, and human rights for all. In terms of  framing  all  of  SDGs,  this  requires  that  extra  attention  is  paid  specifically  to  the  attainment  of  all  targets and a careful scrutiny of all indicators for impact on vulnerable communities, defined (i) in  26  terms of gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, national origin, sexual orientation, and social or other  status, with further attention to women within these communities; and (ii) to women as a category  across all indicators, including in terms of the right of all women to healthcare, including sexual and  reproductive health, education and income, the right to live free from violence.     27  The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) engages scientists, engineers, business and civil society leaders, and development practitioners for evidence-based problem solving. It promotes solutions initiatives that demonstrate the potential of technical and business innovation to support sustainable development. www.unsdsn.org", "Planetary Boundaries": "Sustainable Development and Planetary Boundaries Draft for Discussion Background paper for the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda Prepared by the co-chairs of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network Thematic Group on Macroeconomics, Population Dynamics, and Planetary Boundaries: Johan Rockstrm Executive Director, Stockholm Resilience Centre Professor of Environmental Science, Stockholm University Jeffrey D. Sachs Director, The Earth Institute, Columbia University Director, The Sustainable Development Solutions Network Special Advisor to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on the Millennium Development Goals with Marcus C. hman Associate Professor and Senior Researcher in Ecology and Environmental Science, Stockholm Resilience Centre Guido Schmidt-Traub Executive Director, The Sustainable Development Solutions Network 15 March 2013 Draft for Discussion The world faces a serious challenge, indeed one that is unique to our age. Developing countries rightly yearn to catch up with the living standards enjoyed in developed countries. If incomes in middle- and low-income countries were to catch up with incomes in high-income countries (roughly $41,000 per capita), there would be a roughly 3.4-fold increase in global income from $87 trillion to $290 trillion, which would increase even further if high-income countries grow further and as the world population grows. And therein lies the problem. If the Earths natural resource base were infinite, catching up by developing countries, continued growth in high-income countries, and further global population growth, would all be relatively straightforward. To catch up with the rich countries, the developing countries would invest in technology, infrastructure, and human capital (especially health and education), and step by step, would narrow the income gap with todays high-income countries. That, after all, is the current trajectory of Brazil, China, and India. It is also the preceding path of Japan and Korea. It is the hoped-for path of Africa as well. Yet the Earths natural resource base is not infinite. There is a global adding-up constraint that is not evident at the country level. Until recently, there were always under-utilized primary resources on the planet: for example new lands, new fossil-fuel reserves, and newly mined groundwater. Moreover, the worlds ecosystems could absorb the waste of human activity: carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, nitrogen runoff from fertilizers, and even toxic pollutants dissipated by the oceans and rivers. Humanity could improve the productivity of hunting, fishing, mining, logging, and other harvesting activities without fear of ultimate depletion of those resources. Now, however, the planet is crowded with 7.2 billion of us demanding primary resources, and the Earths seemingly vast limits are being hit and hit hard. As a result global sustainability has become a prerequisite for human development at all scales, from the local community to nations and the world economy. Various concepts exist to describe global environmental constraints: carrying capacity, sustainable consumption and production, guardrails, tipping points, footprints, safe operating space or planetary boundaries. We will employ the concept of planetary boundaries (Rockstrm et al 2009a), which provides a powerful description of the global adding-up constraints across key dimensions. The concept of planetary boundaries has been developed to outline a safe operating space for humanity that carries a low likelihood of harming the life support systems on Earth to such an extent that they no longer are able to support economic growth and human development. As this paper explains, planetary boundaries do not place a cap on human development. Instead they provide a safe space for innovation, growth and development in the pursuit of human prosperity in an increasingly populated and wealthy world. The nine planetary boundaries (Annex I) come in three main forms: 1. Boundaries defining a safe global level of depleting non-renewable fossil resources, such as energy (coal, oil, gas), and fossil groundwater; 2 Draft for Discussion 2. Boundaries defining a safe global level of using the living biosphere, including exploitation of ecosystems, protection of biodiversity and consuming renewable resources, such as land use; 3. Boundaries providing a safe global level of Earths capacity to absorb and dissipate human waste flows, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and toxic chemicals such as pesticides. Some question the concept of planetary boundaries, in particular whether we face risks of abrupt, irreversible changes, with potentially catastrophic implications for poverty alleviation and human development. Yet, the scientific evidence has hardened substantially, and not just in the area of climate change (State of the Planet Declaration, 2012; Stockholm Memorandum; 2011; UNEP, 2012; Science 2011). We now have robust and rising scientific evidence that we have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, where humanity has become a global force of change at the planetary scale (Crutzen 2002). For the first time we are seeing evidence of human- induced changes on how the Earth system operates  from accelerated melting of ice sheets to shifts in rainfall patterns and the undermining of ecosystems and biodiversity. These global environmental changes can undermine long-term development opportunities and trigger abrupt changes for human societies (e.g. heat waves, droughts and floods, rapid sea level rise, pandemics and ecosystem collapse). The confluence of unmet aspirations for human progress and economic development on one side and planetary boundaries on the other requires us to define a new framework for sustainable development that will permit economic and human development within the boundaries of the life-support systems on Earth (Griggs et al. 2013). This paper outlines such a framework: Section I outlines the political and normative choices imposed by a conflict between planetary boundaries and humanitys aspiration for economic growth. Section II describes a sustainable development scenario for the world and Section III discusses its practical feasibility. Section IV concludes with implications for the post-2015 agenda and the work of the High-Level Panel. To keep this paper as succinct as possible, the Annexes provide additional information and references for the interested reader. I. What are the implications of planetary boundaries for economic growth? This question is usually answered with reference to three unattractive alternatives: Can Economic Growth and Planetary Boundaries be Reconciled? 1. Kick away the ladder: The rich world is lucky to have reached a high level of income first. Low- and middle-income countries cannot grow further, to ensure the world stays within planetary boundaries. 2. Contract and converge: Rich countries need to substantially reduce their standard of living, and developing countries can grow until they converge at the lower income of high-income countries. At that point economic growth would need to stop. 3. Business as usual (BAU): In the absence of a shared global framework individual countries fail to acknowledge planetary boundaries in national policymaking. They each scramble for scarce resources. Fossil fuel and food prices soar, and planetary boundaries 3 Draft for Discussion are exceeded as the middle-income countries catch up with the high-income countries. The weakest countries find themselves pushed out of the marketplace and fail to develop. This zero-sum or negative-sum struggle can easily turn nasty. Richer countries will guard their advantage with military force if necessary (Annex II describes the BAU scenario in detail). Options 1 and 2 appear politically impossible in HICs, MICs, and LICs alike. Developing countries around the world want to achieve economic progress, end extreme poverty in all its forms, and achieve higher per capita incomes. These aspirations are right and cannot be compromised on. An agenda that posits barriers to growth will not be supported by politicians and people around the world. Likewise, it seems impossible that politicians in rich countries would ever agree to drastically lower the standard of living. And why would developing countries agree to stop economic growth at a level of income that is below the income enjoyed by rich countries today? We therefore believe that the BAU path is the most likely scenario and that it will lead to a highly unequal world that is also unstable and often violent. We know that the rich and powerful have a high tolerance for massive inequalities in wealth, income, and physical security. Yet we also believe that humanity can and should aim much higher than an open competition for increasingly scarce global resources. Rather than knowingly crossing the planetary boundaries, the world can agree and cooperate on living within the playing field they imply, by adopting improved technologies, stabilizing the worlds population, and protecting threatened species and ecosystems. Such a strategy would leave all regions of the world better off than on the BAU path. Placing the world on such a Sustainable Development Trajectory, we believe, must be a central objective of the post-2015 framework. II. The Sustainable Development (SD) Trajectory addresses the planetary boundaries in a new way: not by an open struggle for resources, nor by contraction of high-income levels, nor by kicking away the ladder. We propose that the world should live within the planetary boundaries through the deployment of new sustainable technologies and new global rules of the game. Our contention is that an orderly and cooperative process will lead to dramatically improved outcomes for all parts of the world. The SDSN is developing a simplified quantitative model for the BAU and Sustainable Development Trajectory, which will be completed soon in its first generation. Preliminary results from this modeling work suggest that a Sustainable Development Trajectory would comprise six major structural transformations to ensure that the world continues to develop economically while staying within planetary boundaries. We emphasize that these transformations would only form a subset of a post-2015 agenda, since they do not fully address issues such as ending extreme poverty, gender equality, health, education, and so forth (Annex IV and SDSN 2013). Each of the transformations outlined in this section requires detailed strategies, major ongoing R&D efforts and continuous problem solving. A lot remains unknown about how exactly these transformations might work. Yet, we do know enough to get started with confidence that remaining issues can be resolved. The Sustainable Development Trajectory 4 Draft for Discussion II.1. The Energy Transformation Perhaps the most important transformation for the sustainable development trajectory is the shift towards a low-carbon economy. This shift must occur for two reasons. First, under a BAU trajectory the world will likely experience a likely 3-5C increase in temperatures by the end of this century that would expose all countries to catastrophic climate change, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, extreme storms, droughts, floods, crop failures, and the collapse of whole ecosystems (World Bank 2012). In 2011 the world emitted some 4.9tCO2e per capita in greenhouse gases from energy use and consumption alone (EDGAR 2013). This must come down to 2tCO2e per capita by 2050 (Stern 2009). Most of the reduction effort must occur in the energy sector, which accounts for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, we are depleting key fossil fuel resources, notably conventional oil and gas but also coal, which will drive up fossil fuel prices and make traditional means of power generation and transport fuels more expensive. Unconventional oil and gas will increase fossil fuel supplies (at the cost of more CO2 emissions of course), but are unlikely to break the upward trend of fossil- fuel costs. The structural rise in fossil fuel costs and the resulting economic incentive to shift towards cleaner fuels is often under-emphasized in discussions on energy and climate policy. The SD trajectory embraces the high social returns to early development and deployment of renewable energies. The underlying analysis is described further in Annex III. An emerging, though still incomplete, body of research outlines the key components of the transformation to low-carbon energy systems. This early research underscores the economic and technological feasibility of a massive decline in carbon emissions by 2050 in high-income countries (Williams et al. 2012, ECF 2010, Ekins et al. 2013). The key elements of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include: (i) electrification of vehicle transport and heating/cooling for buildings; (ii) almost CO2-free electricity generation by 2050 using a balance of renewables (essentially wind, solar), nuclear and carbon capture storage (CCS); (iii) major energy efficiency gains; (iv) advanced biofuels for a small but significant share of transport; and (v) land-use change and emission reduction in agriculture. Critically, the details of such transformations, including their costs, need to be worked out for each region depending on renewable energy endowments, legacy infrastructure, population distribution, etc. Much less is known about how these transformations can be achieved in Upper Middle-income Countries, but it appears likely that their de-carbonization strategies will include broadly similar elements. II.2. The Food Security Transformation The global demand for food will increase due to rising incomes and an additional two or three billion people to feed. At the same time, the worlds food supply will be under threat because of growing ecological pressures. Climate change will threaten large growing regions susceptible to drought, floods, extreme storms, and temperature stress. Depletion of groundwater and melting of glaciers will threaten many food-growing regions with increased water stress. Loss of biodiversity may undermine crop productivity. The list of risks is long. 5 Draft for Discussion An important step towards meeting this challenge is to head off the worst of climate change through de-carbonizing the energy system as described above. Climate change has already begun to destabilize the worlds food supply, with massive crop failures in recent years in Argentina, Australia, China, Russia, Ukraine, US, and other grain exporting regions. We have also seen severe droughts in highly vulnerable food-importing regions like the Sahel, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. The resulting food crises are likely to worsen under the BAU scenario. Yet, agriculture itself needs to undergo major systems changes to meet rising demand and ensure food security. Rising food production must be decoupled from unsustainable utilization of water, energy, fertilizers, chemicals and land. This will require a multi-faceted agro-ecological intensification of food production involving at least four steps (after Doberman and Nelson 2013. See also Conway 2012, IAAST 2009, WEF 2010, and World Bank 2008). First, we must increase productivity by at least 70% on existing crop and pasture land (FAO 2009). New technologies  better seeds, micro-dosing of fertilizers, precision farming, no-till farming, drip- and other precision-irrigation, integrated pest management, etc.  offer ways to raise crop productivity while lowering the impact of farming on the climate and biodiversity. Yet, food production is a highly localized activity, dependent on ecology, soils, culture, institutions, and many other factors. There are no one-size fits all approaches to creating a sustainable food system. The changeover to Complex Farming, as we like to call it, is a major transformation, requiring research, development, agricultural extension, and improved economic incentives for farmers. It wont happen by itself. Second and closely related, the intensification of agriculture must occur without significant extensification (expansion of land under cultivation). The resource use efficiency of agriculture (water, fertilizer, agrochemicals) must increase dramatically to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture including its substantial contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 from land-use change and energy inputs; methane from animal husbandry and rice cultivation; and N2O from fertilizer use). Third, targeted support is needed for smallholder farmers in impoverished regions who have minimal resources but need to grapple with climate change, water depletion, biodiversity loss, and land erosion. Unless smallholder farmers can become more productive to sustain their families, the pressure on marginal land and biodiversity will only rise. Finally, a food security transformation will require a drastic reduction in food waste. Much food is lost post-harvest due to improper storage, spoilage, problems in transportation, etc. Reducing food waste can dramatically increase the food supply without increasing yields or the amount of farmland used. The SDSN Thematic Group on Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems is preparing a detailed background brief for the HLP that will describe the food security transformation in detail and document its feasibility. 6 Draft for Discussion II.3. The Urban Sustainability Transformation Urbanization is proceeding at a very rapid pace in all developing countries. Between today and 2050 the share of the world population living in urban areas is expected to rise from approximately 50 percent to around 67 percent. The scale and speed of this change is unprecedented in human history. China alone is expected to add some 250 million new urban citizens from 2010 to 2025. Global investments in urban infrastructure and building are expected to rise from $10 trillion today to more than $20 trillion by 2025, with urban centers in emerging economies attracting the most of this investment (Revi and Rosenzweig 2013). Due to their higher population densities, well-managed cities can provide high-quality social services, infrastructure as well as environmental services to their populations. They can increase per capita resource use efficiency much more easily than less densely populated areas. Yet, these opportunities can only be seized if cities have strong and effective governments that work well with their local communities to support more energy efficient building, modernized transport systems (electrified vehicles, mass transit, bicycle paths), smart power grids, and efficient use of natural resources. Urban infrastructure investments can have a lifetime of well over 50 years, so it is vital that resource-efficient investments be made soon. At the same time, cities must become more resilient to environmental change and disasters. Most of the worlds great cities are on the seacoast or river-ways, which makes them highly vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges, and coastal pollution. In recent years, many of the worlds leading cities, including New York, Beijing, Moscow, New Delhi, Paris, and others have suffered from extraordinary environmental crises, including massive storms, flooding, heat waves, droughts, and more. To increase resilience, cities must inter alia upgrade their infrastructure, introduce zoning and siting policies to avoid floods, and manage water resources and waste sustainably. II.4. The Population Transformation The worlds population growth rate has slowed down significantly in recent decades, but this is now occurring off a higher base. The absolute number of people added each year will not fall substantially until mid-century ( Figure 1). The figure also shows the major differences across the three fertility variants. The higher the worlds population the harder it will be for the world to achieve the SD Trajectory (see Population Division (2011a)1 for a full discussion of why population growth needs to be slowed as much as possible). 1 Hania Zlotnik, the author of this paper, is a member of the Leadership Council of the SDSN. 7 Draft for Discussion Figure 1: UN Projections of the world population according to three different assumptions about future fertility (Population Division 2011b) Most of the high-income world and much of the middle-income world has already reached a low fertility rate, notably at or below replacement levels (roughly 2.05 children per woman on average), but fertility rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and parts of the Middle-East, remain very high. Sub-Saharan Africas population is projected to rise from 856 million in 2010 to more than 3.3 billion by 2100, unless the fertility rate is reduced. In a world of land scarcity, water stress, and climate change, such dramatic increases in Sub-Saharan Africas population will likely lead to a Malthusian catastrophe. Similar conclusions apply to the BAU population trajectories in many countries across North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. To head off these threats, countries need to complete the job of the demographic transition through voluntary fertility reduction. The young people of Sub-Saharan Africa will follow their counterparts in Asia and Latin America in choosing to have fewer children if they are also availed of the key reasons for fertility reduction: education at least through secondary level, an end to marriage for young girls, access to contraception, an end to taboos on family planning, women empowerment, and improvement in child survival. The introduction of social security programs in Africa (e.g. pension schemes) can also help, so that children are not the main source of parents financial security. For more details on the elements and feasibility of the population transformation see Population Division (2011a). II.5. The Biodiversity Management Transformation Biodiversity protection describes the slowing of species loss2 and the protection of habitats, ecosystems and biomes  all of which are under severe stress around the world. Since biodiversity plays a profound role in regulating Earths system it must be maintained if humanity is to achieve the SD Trajectory. 2 As explained in Annex I, the planetary boundaries framework uses species loss as indicator for biodiversity loss. 8 Draft for Discussion A biodiversity management transformation at global scale would comprise strategies for managing the worlds species that will operate at local and regional scales where the species live. It would also include strategies for preserving the six critical biomes that constitute key global regulating systems of concern for humanity as a whole, irrespective of where one lives. Rockstrm and Klum (2012) outline six such critical biomes:  The Polar regions,  The remaining tropical rainforests,  The ocean marine system,  The worlds permafrost regions,  Temperate forests, and  The worlds savannahs. Successful strategies for biodiversity management and ecosystem preservation are complex to design and require coordinated policies over a long time frame. They are also very site and context specific. Many operational questions remain unanswered and will require intense and continuous problem solving for each biodiversity management challenge. II.6. The Private and Public Governance Transformation One of the most difficult but important challenges will be the governance transformation. In an age of planetary boundaries public policy decisions must be made on the basis of scientific evidence. Environmental degradation is often aggravated by lack of transparency and accountability of local and national governments. When public institutions are weak or corrupt, when they do not respect the rule of law, then the public goods of sound environmental management tend to be massively underprovided. Improving governance at local, provincial and national levels is of course very complex and takes a long time. A focus on planetary boundaries requires a careful look at international governance and its compatibility with achieving the SD Trajectory. First, global problems require global institutions that are representative of the world they help govern. The voting rights and shares in many international institutions reflect the world as it was after the Second World War and not the world as it is today. This imbalance ought to be addressed so that global institutions can speak with greater legitimacy. At the same time, todays emerging economies will need to take greater responsibility in the financing of these institutions and of global public goods more generally. Second, many international environmental negotiations (e.g. under the UNFCCC) proceed on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, which becomes a recipe for gridlock. Such gridlock can be exacerbated by WTO and other rules (e.g. bilateral investment treaties) that make it hard for individual countries to enact stronger environmental standards without violating these rules or without fear of competition from non-compliers. For example, a growing number of researchers and policymakers advocate border tax adjustment tariffs as a necessary means to allow individual countries to enact bigger curbs on greenhouse gas emissions without threatening their industrial base. Trade and other international rules should therefore meet the additional test of whether they are constituent with moving towards an SD Trajectory. Where this is not the 9 Draft for Discussion case safeguards need to be put in place to allow individual countries to move forward while others are still dithering. Third, multinational businesses are now the most powerful actors on the world stage, with financial resources, technological know-how, management capacity, scale of operations, political influence, and the power of capital mobility (shifting operations from high-tax and high- regulation regions to low-tax and low-regulation regions), that dwarfs most or all governments. Yet multinational companies must also be made accountable for their actions. They must be transparent (not able to hide in tax havens), pay their taxes, use their political influence responsibly, and clean up after their environmental damages according to the polluter pay principle. All of this will require fundamental changes to some business models. Bakker and Leisinger (2013) identify four steps that business must take towards the SD Trajectory: 1. Do no harm (e.g. through environmental externalities) and adhere to the UN Global Compact standards for responsible behaviour. 2. Integrate sustainability into core business strategies. 3. Reflect sustainability challenges in long-term risk assessments for every company through investors and capital markets. 4. Institute better ways of measuring the value and true performance of companies by internalizing externalities. Examples are the E-P&L developed by Puma, Integrated Reporting (IIRC), TEEB for Business, GRI and SASB pricing of externalities. These are some important steps that businesses everywhere need to undertake to better align private incentives with public interest. Others include responsible advertising, shifting the tax burden from goods to bads, and responsible lobbying (see for example Sukhdev 2012). III. The Feasibility of the Sustainable Development Trajectory Our overarching point is the following. The BAU trajectory is a dark threat for the world in an age of planetary boundaries. Todays developing countries will not be able to develop simply on the basis of the same technologies and business models as the high-income world. All countries will need to converge to new sustainable technologies and new rules of the game. Fairness and efficiency will require that all countries and regions share in the process according to global goals and standards. Most importantly, we will need a rapid technological overhaul in all regions of the world to ensure that all countries can continue to benefit from 21st century technology without wrecking the planet at the same time. The challenges to achieve the SD trajectory are ethical, political, technological, and organizational. The ethical challenge starts from the premise that the rich world cannot simply kick the ladder away from todays poor countries. They have neither the power nor the right to do so. The ethical foundation of sustainable development is convergence: that all of the world should enjoy symmetrical benefits of human knowledge and technology, meaning that all countries should live in roughly comparable conditions over time. There should be a gradual convergence of living standards, technologies, and demographic patterns in the course of this century. If the world needs a new low-carbon energy system, it is the responsibility of all 10 Draft for Discussion countries, rich and poor. If we need to stabilize the worlds population, this is also the responsibility of all countries, rich and poor. We therefore take convergence (or alternatively, the right to development) as the starting point, ethically and practically. The political challenge is to create a new global framework  both in the form of global goals and rules -- to avoid a scramble of all against all. This will entail not only the formulation of sustainable development goals foreseen by the Rio+20 outcome document, but also clear binding rules of action under environmental, trade, and technology treaties and agreements. And as we noted, part of those rules will involve the new accountability of multinational companies, the main drivers of the world economy today. The technological challenge is clear: to shift our industrial-age technologies to new information- age technologies, in energy, food production, transport, finance, health, education, and other sectors. We are in the midst of an information technology revolution driven by Moores Law (the reduction by half in the cost of processing, storing, and transmitting data every 18-24 months). The costs of processing, transmitting, and storing data has declined by a factor of roughly one billion since 1960. This is enabling the revolution of mobile phones (7 billion subscribers), smart grids, social networking, and breakthroughs in countless fields of big data: genomics, nanotechnology, agronomics, mapping, entertainment, finance, and much more. These are the bases for the new sustainable technologies, since they in general allow us to substitute bits and bytes for physical commodities, such as converting books to e-books, malls to online shopping, ATMs to mobile banking, and a thousand other applications. The Sustainable Development Trajectory can be achieved, but it is an unprecedented and massive technological and organizational challenge. And time is very short. The world economy is so large and dynamic  growing at 4 percent per year, and therefore doubling every two decades  that we are on a collision course with planetary boundaries that will require much more than weak market signals alone. For the first time in human history, we will have to consciously steer the direction of technological change rapidly and on a global scale. That is the essence of the SD Trajectory. IV. This paper identifies the transformations needed to ensure continued human progress for all in the age of planetary boundaries. As mentioned at the outset, these transformations cover only parts of a viable post-2015 agenda. The SDSN Draft Framework Document (SDSN 2013) underscores that such an agenda would need to address all dimensions of sustainable development, including ending extreme poverty in all its forms. In summary we propose the following items for consideration by the High-Level Panel: Implications for the High-Level Panel and the Post-2015 Agenda 1. The science of planetary boundaries makes clear that we are on an unsustainable trajectory. The world must reject the three baseline scenarios outlined in Section I (kick away the ladder, contract and converge, business-as-usual (BAU)) and strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Trajectory. 11 Draft for Discussion 2. Achieving the Sustainable Development Trajectory will require an unprecedented global effort by all countries  rich and poor  that will only be possible under a shared global framework for sustainable development. Such a global framework must have the following features: a. Provide an ethical foundation based on the principle of convergence and the right to development3; b. Tackle the six transformations outlined in Section II (energy, agriculture, urbanization, population, fragile states, biodiversity), which will require inter alia an unprecedented mobilization of technology; c. Address the other challenges of sustainable development, including ending extreme poverty in all its forms, ensuring social cohesion, improving the governance of the public and private sectors, and developing an effective global partnership. See Annex IV for a preliminary draft list of the operational priorities identified by the SDSN Leadership Council for the post-2015 development agenda. 3 Others have framed this ethical foundation as humanity and reciprocity (Khler 2013) 12 Draft for Discussion References V.

Geneva. 2010. 15 Draft for Discussion Annex I: The Science of Planetary Boundaries The planetary boundary framework below is based on a decades research suggesting a safe operating space for humanity. This was brought forward as a priority in the report from the UN Secretary-Generals High Level Panel Resilient People Resilient Planet (UNs Secretary- Generals High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability 2012). It stated that we should defend the science that shows we are destabilizing our climate and stretching planetary boundaries to a perilous degree. In their report, Rockstrm and co-workers (Rockstrm et al 2009a) name nine planetary boundaries. These concern various global system issues including climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, freshwater use, land system change, ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, chemical pollution and aerosol loading ( Table 1). Planetary boundary Boundaries quantified 1. Climate change 2. Biological diversity loss 3. Biogeochemical cycles 4. Global freshwater use 5. Land system change 6. Ocean acidification 7. Stratospheric ozone CO2 concentration in the atmosphere should be limited to 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing An annual rate of a maximum of 10 extinctions per million species Nitrogen (N) cycle - limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Mt N yr-1) Phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P Limited to 4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources Not more than 15% of the ice-free land surface used as cropland Mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite at not less than 80% of pre-industrial levels Maximum 5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units 8. Chemical pollution No boundary defined 9. Atmospheric aerosol loading No boundary defined Table 1: Planetary Boundaries (Source: Rockstrm et al. 2009a) 16 Draft for Discussion The red areas in Figure 2 show the position of each boundary. The safe operating space for the boundaries are within the green area. Out of these nine boundaries at least three have already been passed: climate change, biodiversity loss, and the nitrogen cycle. Figure 2: Planetary Boundaries (Source: Rockstrm et al 2009a) Climate change is the boundary that, at a global level, has received most attention (e.g. IPCC 2007). It has been suggested that a safe temperature increase should be limited to 2C. Within the planetary boundary framework the level of concern relates to the source, focusing on the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. With a precautionary approach it has been set at 350 ppm CO2 (which is still much higher than the pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of 270 ppm). Notably, the suggested boundary of 350 ppm CO2 was passed some years back and today the CO2 level is close to 400 ppm and increasing. There are data that suggest that the planet was almost ice free until concentrations of carbon dioxide fell below 450 ppm (100 ppm) (Hansen et al 2008). According to the World Bank report Turn down the heat (World Bank 2012) chances are that the increase will be even larger. It should in this context be noted that climate change is not about a simple linear relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature; there is more complexity than that. For example, as glaciers melt more heat is absorbed (mostly due to changes in albedo) which will worsen the situation even further. With big climatic changes (an increase of several degrees) devastating consequences for large proportions of society will follow. Weather patterns as we know them will change. Precipitation is expected to become more variable as well as increase in many areas. Dry areas will not necessarily benefit; on the contrary, dry areas are likely to become even dryer. Extreme weather will follow with, for example, more storms and heat waves. Food production and water 17 Draft for Discussion availability will be reduced in many areas. Sea level rise will have a major impact on coastal areas. Notably all this will be costly to society. This is one of many examples of the costs involved in passing a planetary boundary. According to the UK Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, acknowledging climate change and working to prevent it is an investment; at its core it is about economic growth (Stern 2006). Biodiversity is another planetary boundary of major concern that has been passed. Biodiversity is a measure of variation in nature. The specific boundary chosen as a measure for biodiversity in the planetary boundary framework is the rate of extinction. Before industrialization the extinction rate was less than one species per million species each year. At present more than 100 species out of a million are going extinct each year. The proposed boundary is set at 10 species per million species per year. Biodiversity is the control panel for those living on Earth. Big changes in biodiversity will have major effects on the Earth system. Biodiversity is the natural capital we depend on to sustain ecosystem functions. There are many benefits for humans that in a direct manner relate to biodiversity, including clean air and water, food security, and health. Biodiversity loss comes with a price. According to The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity the costs of the loss of terrestrial ecosystem services is estimated to be USD 50 billion per year (TEEB 2008). Notably biodiversity is not only about species numbers. It also concerns variability in terms of habitats, ecosystems, and biomes. Habitat and ecosystem availability is essential for species diversity; if they disappear so will species. To quote the world renowned biologist E.O. Wilson: The one process that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats. This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us. This can be illustrated with the highly diversified coral reef ecosystems. On coral reefs a large number of fish species are only found in association with certain coral habitats (hman and Rajasuriya 1998). If the corals are degraded due to temperature rise, as a consequence of climate change, not only the corals disappear but also the fish species associated with them (Garpe et al 2006). Biomes are ecological regions at a global scale such as tropical rainforests, boreal forests (taiga), grasslands, tundra, and deserts. Since they are formed primarily due to variation in temperature and precipitation their distribution is mainly determined by climate and hence sensitive to climate change. With increased temperatures whole biomes can start changing in character. This can interact with a range of ecological components. For example, increased temperatures boost the outbreak of the mountain pine beetle that is devastating forests in western Canada (Taylor et al 2007). Climate affects biomes but it also works the other way around, i.e. biomes affect climate and other processes within the Earths system. If biomes are altered this may change the climate in a profound manner, passing thresholds and causing long-term changes. In this respect all biomes are important and play a role to uphold the Earth system as we know it. Some biomes may play a more critical role in influencing climate and should be given attention accordingly. Forests, for example, affect a range of factors that relate to climate such as precipitation. Their importance in carbon sequestration is well known, and again we can return to the example with the mountain pine beetle. Where the outbreak occurred, the forest went from being a carbon sink to a carbon source (Kurz et al 2008). Critical biomes should not only be characterized by the role 18 Draft for Discussion they may play to uphold a stable climate. It is also important to consider their sensitivity to human activities and how easily humans can change their structure and content. Technically speaking, deforestation is easily done and it causes a major ecological change where it occurs. The cycles of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are essential for life on Earth. The availability of N and P in the biosphere has increased massively over the last decades. More atmospheric N is now transformed into reactive forms than all the naturally occurring processes on land (Rockstrm et al 2009b). This has major environmental impacts. Large quantities of reactive N result in nutrient overload (eutrophication) in soils, waterways, lakes, and seas. It also affects the atmosphere. Excessive nutrients in lakes and seas cause algal blooms, which may lead to oxygen depletion. The usage of P is still within the boundary. However, the amount of N taken out from the atmosphere is beyond what would be considered a sustainable level. The present amount of atmospheric N (N2) that is removed is 121 million tons per year; the proposed boundary is set at 35 million tons per year. Thus, this is a boundary that has been passed by a wide margin. There is an ongoing debate on the relevance of planetary boundaries and how they may be quantified. The discussion will continue and other boundaries may be added or existing ones may be re-defined. The key point is that living on Earth is dependent on a basic life-support system in which the nine boundaries mentioned here play a very important role. Planetary boundaries define a planetary playing field that guide humanity on how to avoid environmental changes on a global scale.

Ambio 40: 739-761 20 Draft for Discussion Annex II: The Business-as-Usual Scenario For an illustrative business-as-usual (BAU) trajectory we assume the absence of a shared global framework for sustainable development and uncoordinated economic policies. The BAU path reflects the current fundamental drivers of global change. There are eight that are of prime significance: 1. Continued population growth concentrated mostly in developing countries and being especially fast in poorer countries. With an acceleration of fertility decline in the high- fertility countries of today, the global population is projected to rise from 6.8 billion in 2010 to 8.3 billion in 2030, 9.3 billion in 2050, and 10.3 billion in 2100. 2. The tendency on average for the economies of developing countries to grow more rapidly than those of rich countries as the developing countries close the technology gap. The current global growth pattern is of 1-2 per cent annual growth in high-income countries compared with 5-6 per cent growth in developing countries (all growth is calculated in purchasing-power-parity adjusted units). 3. High variance in GDP growth rates among countries, within both the developed and developing groups. Among developed countries, for example, Southern Europe is in deep economic decline, while Northern Europe is not. Among developing countries, most in East Asia are growing rapidly, while the poorer regions of Africa and the Middle East are in turmoil. 4. Rapid but uneven development and diffusion of information technologies building on Moores Law. 5. Intensifying environmental stresses: global warming, unstable precipitation, loss of species habitat, ocean acidification, over-harvesting of fauna and flora (fishing, poaching, deforestation, etc.) 6. Depletion of conventional oil reserves and uncertain overall reserves of other key fossil fuels (coal, natural gas) and other minerals (e.g. phosphates), leading to high natural resource prices. 7. Instability of global food supplies resulting from the imbalance of rising global food demand and a relatively static and volatile supply-side. 8. Social, economic, and political instability in major regions (Sahel, Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia). Notice that the BAU trajectory fails to achieve sustainable development in multiple ways. Some regions fail to escape extreme poverty. Most regions suffer from high inequality and lack of social inclusion. The entire world experiences unprecedented environmental degradation (climate change, loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, loss of habitat, rising sea level) that will make every country and region worse off by 2050. The diverging economic prospects and high population growth in low-income countries will increase migration flows across the world. If poorly managed these migration flows stand to increase social divisions and tensions. Without improved cooperation, multinational corporations may be free to arbitrage across countries, thus putting major pressure on public revenues in every country. 21 Draft for Discussion The reason for the poor results of the BAU scenario is the failure of global cooperation around a shared framework for sustainable development. A global market economy without cooperation around a shared framework is not equipped to ensure widespread use of new technologies, address environmental threats (especially climate change), support vulnerable regions, reduce inequalities between skilled and unskilled workers, and provide opportunities for all children. In short, a BAU world will not witness the broad-based economic, social, and environmental transformations needed in every country to achieve sustainable growth with equity. In Error!

Their utilization continues to rise rapidly as the world economy expands. There is considerable debate about the long-run global supply curves for various fossil-fuel energy sources. This issue is of crucial significance. The long-term supply curve of fossil fuels will affect future growth prospects, optimum investments in renewable and nuclear energy sources, and prospects for CO2 emissions in the long run. The long-term supply conditions differ markedly, though uncertainly, across the major categories of fossil fuels: conventional oil, non-conventional oil (shale oil), natural gas (conventional and shale gas), and coal of various grades. One common view is that conventional oil is becoming more scarce (peak oil) while the other forms of oil (e.g. shale oil, tar sands), as well as gas and coal are still generally plentiful. Yet this conventional view may be too optimistic. Global energy use is now so large, and is rising so rapidly, that all major forms of fossil fuels may face rising real production costs during the 21st century. The long-term real price of oil is shown in Figure 1. We see that after the initial period of discovery in the 1860s and 1870s, oil prices fell to around $20 per barrel (in $US 2011 prices) for roughly a century, until the early 1970s. Oil prices spiked, fell sharply in the 1980s, and then resumed an upward trajectory in the early 2000s. They are near all-time highs at the moment. Many economists and market experts feel that the recent rise in prices reflects long-term depletion of major fields coupled with the soaring demand from China, India, and other emerging economies. Believers in peak oil argue that conventional oil production will peak very soon, perhaps this decade. According to the 2011 BP Statistical Review, the current Reserve/Production (R/P) ratio is around 54 years, but with the global demand for oil growing rapidly and with major fields in decline, that 54-year estimate might be optimistic. Yes, reserves surely understate the ultimate resource availability (since reserves designate discovered oil that is economically recoverable with todays technologies), yet demand is also soaring and depletion of existing fields is extensive. The International Energy Agency points out that nearly two-thirds of the current production of conventional crude oil (equal to 39.4 mbd) will need to be replaced by 2035 because of depletion of existing fields. (IEA, World Energy Outlook 2012). This will be a very tall order. 23 Draft for Discussion The recent advent of shale gas and shale oil, made possible by two innovations  horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (hydrofracking) of shale to release the oil and gas trapped in the rock  has given rise to considerable industry optimism that new production can meet the rapidly growing world demand for energy (putting aside considerations of CO2 emissions for the moment). Yet its very easy to overstate the global significance of the new shale gas and oil. Consider recent estimates of shale gas reserves in the United States (where production is most advanced) and also globally. The US Energy Information Agency puts the proved shale gas reserves at 97.4 TCF. To put this in perspective, this amounts to 17.46 billion barrels of oil equivalent. With global oil consumption of around 6.8 billion barrels per year (2011), this represents around 2.5 years of oil consumption. This is large, but not fundamentally transformative. Of course the total base of technically recoverable resources is still larger. The US Energy Information Agency (EIA) puts total resources at 862 TCF, or roughly 22 years of current oil use. Worldwide, according to EIA, the total recoverable shale gas resource base might be as large as 6,600 TCF, which works out to about 36 years of current global oil consumption. Note that while worldwide shale gas resources are obviously substantial, they do not really change the fundamental reality that oil and gas resources are likely to be substantially depleted this century (or outcompeted by alternatives). First, not all of the 6,600 TCF will be economically recoverable. Second, the EIA estimate has been criticized as too large, for allegedly not taking into account observed rapid declines in productivity of hydro-fracked gas wells. Third, global demand for oil and gas is rising, so that shale gas must not only replace current production but also meet growing demand. Fourth, the costs of recovering the resource base will probably rise significantly as more marginal fields are brought on line. 24 Draft for Discussion Many observers have argued that coal resources are the ultimate backstop for the worlds fossil fuel economy. Coal resources are very large, arguably available on a centuries-long scale. Since coal can be converted both to gas and liquids (through the Fischer-Tropsch process), coal can conceivably replace depleting oil and gas fields. There are limits to this conversion, of course. Fischer-Tropsch is expensive, capital intensive, and requires a considerable investment lead- time. More fundamentally, though, there are also significant doubts regarding the conventional estimates of plentiful coal reserves. A series of recent studies have argued that there are clear signs of peak coal like peak oil, albeit with the coal peak coming in the 2030s-2050s rather than in the next decade as with conventional oil. One of the surprising features of the current scene is that China, the worlds largest producer and consumer of coal, became a net importer of coal in 2009. This contributed to a rise in global thermal coal prices, from around $20 per ton at the start of the 2000s to around $60 per ton today.

This list may change in coming months in light of comments received on the draft framework document of the SDSN (SDSN 2013) and the reports prepared by the thematic groups of the Solutions Networks. The operational priorities could form the basis for framing post-2015 goals with quantitative targets and metrics to be added. A central challenge in defining operational priorities for the post-2015 agenda is how to tackle inequality. Most inequality is explained by (i) unequal opportunities facing children according to household incomes; and (ii) discrimination of certain groups of society. The first driver of inequality is best addressed by ensuring that every child, whether born to a rich or poor household, has the full chance to develop his or her full physical, cognitive, and economic potential. This requires public financing of human capital  health, early nutrition, early childhood development, primary and secondary school, advanced training  to ensure that children of all classes have an equal opportunity. The challenge of discrimination and exclusion is best tackled through respect for and enforcement of human rights as outlined under priority 4 (see also Castellino and Diop 2013). 1. Ending Extreme Poverty: Extreme poverty in all its forms should be eliminated everywhere (possibly backed by an expanded and extended set of MDG targets to 2030). Special attention will be given to fragile regions that need international support to achieve middle-income status. 2. Promoting Sustainable Growth and Wellbeing: All countries have a right to development based on a global norm of convergence. By 2030, all societies should be middle-income or higher. The measure of GDP should be improved to capture environmental losses and other pertinent non-market phenomena. Broader measures of wellbeing should be deployed including direct measures of subjective wellbeing. 3. Productive Rural Communities and Sustainable Agriculture: To promote the rural economic transformation, create productive, healthy and resilient rural communities. Use improved technologies, farming practices and policies to ensure higher and sustainable yields, crop resilience, protection of ecosystem services, reduced post-harvest losses, and lower food waste. 4. Quality Education, Job Skills, and Decent Work: The world of work is changing rapidly, driven by globalization and technological changes. Youth in particular must be prepared for decent work in the new era through universal quality secondary education and school-to-work policies including vocational training. Early childhood education (ECD) will be expanded to promote equal opportunities for all children. Communication and information technologies can play a central role in expanding access to quality education in all areas. 26 Draft for Discussion 5. Gender Equality, Personal Security, and Human Rights: Ensure that all people enjoy equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion, etc. Provide personal security and freedom from all forms of violence. 6. Healthy Lives and Sustainable Fertility: By 2030 children and mothers should not die of preventable and treatable causes. All families should have access to reproductive health and other services needed for voluntary reductions in fertility rates to stabilize or reduce the worlds and every countrys population. Every country should have a healthy life expectancy of at least 70 years by 2030, and many countries will achieve 80 years or more. This can be achieved through universal access to health services, improved lifestyles, and healthy diets. 7. Productive, Inclusive, and Resilient Cities: To promote the urban economic transformation, create productive, healthy, peaceful and resilient cities, well-adapted to larger populations, job creation, and environmental changes. Cities should be free of slums and debilitating living conditions. 8. Averting Dangerous Climate Change and Industrial Pollution: Decarbonize the energy system by mid-century to avoid a 2-degree Celsius rise of the Earths temperature through energy efficiency and the use of renewable and low-carbon technologies. Adapt to ongoing climate changes. Re-design industrial processes for materials efficiency, recycling, and safe waste management. 9. Protecting Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services: Address market failures that lead to environmental destruction. Protect all key ecosystems, marine and terrestrial, by ensuring sustainable practices of land use, waste management, water use, and other practices. 10. Good Governance, Global Partnership, and Ensuring the Benefits of Technology: Promote transparency, accountability and good governance for public actors (local governments, municipalities, national governments, international organizations), business, civil society, academia and the research community. Ensure an effective international partnership on the basis of a graduated set of global rights and responsibilities. The rules of the international system are made consistent with the trajectory for convergence and sustainable development. Key sustainable technologies should be promoted for early-stage development and for broad global diffusion, especially to ensure the interests of low-income countries. 27", "Natural Resource Management": "Why good governance of land and tenure security need to be part of the Sustainable Development Goal framework Note by the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment* and the SDSN Thematic Group on the Good Governance of Extractive and Land Resources Revised - May 2014 Incorporating good governance of land and tenure security in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework would: 1. 2. 3. 4. Support the protection of a range of tenure rights. Hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers, pastoralists, forest dwellers, and fisherfolk rely on land, forest and water resources, yet many have insecure tenure rights and are vulnerable to displacement and loss of livelihood. Including the issues of land governance and secure tenure would encourage governments to work proactively to ensure that tenure protections are increased in accordance with national SDGs. Promote poverty reduction. In rural areas, land is integral to livelihood strategies. Tenure security helps ensure that women and men can access the natural resources they need to grow food or otherwise earn a living, encourages productivity-enhancing investments and creates opportunities for local communities to directly manage and benefit from those resources. Tenure security can also enable women and men to use their land as collateral in order to access other opportunities. Since nearly 70 percent of the worlds poorest people live in rural areas in developing countries, incorporating land governance and secure land tenure in the SDG framework would promote efforts that are vitally important for poverty reduction, in line with the SDSN proposed Goals 1 and 6. Strengthen food security. Good governance of land helps realize food security at both a household and a global level. For rural households, tenure security is often the crucial link to sustained food security and the right to food. At a global level, good land governance can contribute to the sustainable and strategic use of land for agricultural production, contributing to long-term global food supply. Including land governance and secure land tenure would assist government efforts to achieve food security, in line with the SDSN proposed Goal 1. Empower women. Women produce an estimated 60-80% of food in developing countries, yet they rarely have secure land rights. Improving womens access to land and securing their tenure rights empower women to meet their needs and invest in their children. Doing so is also vital to achieving better food security, health and education outcomes in rural areas. Incorporating land governance and secure land tenure would encourage governments to ensure that efforts to improve tenure security focus in particular on women, in line with SDSN proposed goal 4. 5. Reduce resource conflicts. Tenure insecurity can lead to resource conflicts. Climate variations threaten to exacerbate such conflicts. Good governance of land can help address potential conflicts before they occur, and can provide avenues of redress after * formerly the Vale Columbia Center on Sustainable International Investment 6. 7. conflicts arise. Including land governance and secure land tenure would focus critical attention on managing land resources to reduce and address resource conflicts. Encourage responsible use and management of natural resources. Ensuring that natural resources are used responsibly is essential for sustainable development. Land governance frameworks assist governments to manage natural resources responsibly. In addition, tenure security encourages women and men to use resources more sustainably. Incorporating land governance and secure land tenure would promote the responsible management of land and other natural resources, in line with SDSN proposed goal 9. Help alleviate the impacts of increasing commercial pressures on land. Land is both a natural resource that attracts investment itself and one that is significantly affected by other natural resource projects, such as those in the extractive industries. Commercial pressures on land have been growing steadily, with significant implications for individuals who depend on land but lack tenure security to defend their rights and access to such land. These increased pressures, combined with weak land governance, can fuel conflict and human rights violations, exacerbate poverty and otherwise negatively affect sustainable development goals. Including land governance and secure land tenure would help governments address these concerns through explicit safeguards that protect vulnerable land users. For these reasons, we recommend the inclusion of the following indicators on land and tenure security as part of the proposed SDSN indicator framework:1 Target 6c. Ensure universal access in rural areas to basic resources and infrastructure services (land, water, sanitation, markets, mobile and broadband communication, agricultural inputs, and advisory services). Indicator: Percentage of women and men in rural areas with secure rights to land, measured by (i) percentage with documented rights to land, and (ii) percentage who do not fear arbitrary dispossession of land Target 7b. Ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services including housing; water, sanitation and waste management; low-carbon energy and transport; and mobile and broadband communication. Indicator: Percentage of women and men in urban areas with security of tenure, measured by (i) percentage with documented rights to housing, and (ii) percentage who do not fear arbitrary eviction This proposed indicator comprises two complementary components, documentation and perception, which provide critical information on tenure security. In addition, they both highlight outcomes and on-the-ground realities. The proposed focus on documented rights is flexible enough to cover a range of tenure rights in different country contexts. Because documentation alone, while important, is often not sufficient to gauge true tenure security, the perception measure provides valuable complementary information. In addition, the perception measure may facilitate more useful comparisons across countries. This proposed indicator is not yet measured or calculated in a systematic way, so there is a need to develop this for future SDG monitoring. 1 See: Sustainable Development Solutions Network, (2014), Indicators for Sustainable Development Goals  Working Draft, Paris, France and New York, USA: SDSN.

This opportunity must not be missed. For global agri- culture systems to produce enough food to feed nine or ten billion people by 2050, there will have to be a shift in consumer and producer behavior and a structural change toward leveraging more sophisti- cated technologies, information and knowledge management systems, and policies that promote market-based incentives for growth. The 2015 to 2030 period must become a period of serious transition toward food systems that operate on the principle of Sustainable Agricultural Intensi- fication (SAI). Concerted, coordinated action is needed to make the path toward greater food and nutrition security the new global standard, rather than the exception. Structured assessments for local solutions While the high-level Sustainable Development Goals for the post-2015 era will galvanize the global community to work towards shared goals, each country and locality must choose its own agri- cultural transformation path that is scalable and measurable at all levels. National and local govern- ments need to take the lead in designing and implementing roadmaps and business plans for development that are goal-oriented and approp- riately account for priorities, feasibility, and costs. A structured assessment to develop such a plan typically includes five steps: background analysis of past trends and future projections; definition of key problems and opportunities; assessment of different technology and policy options; estimation of out- comes and effects; and modeling of impacts on development goals and targets, including the costs and benefits across sectors. large farms for both Such an assessment should be used to devise strategies that produce substantial surpluses and small farms that support the livelihoods of millions of rural people. Two primary factors that will shape tailored solutions for future agricultural development are resource endowment and access to markets (see Figure 1). Generally, countries need to move away from basing agricultural planning on subjective and theoretically instead basing decisions on a thorough understanding of the socioeconomic and biophysical factors that drive the needs of farmers, agribusinesses, small entre- preneurs, consumers, and many other actors. important factors, Figure 1. Different solutions will be required for large and small farms with varying access to resources and markets. Guiding principles for implementing SAI Although the pathways toward achieving more sustainable agriculture and food systems will vary around there are several guiding principles that policymakers should consider. Most importantly, governments and international agencies must make forward with SAI for moving the world,  The Thematic Group is co-chaired by Achim Dobermann and Rebecca Nelson.

Moreover, though there will be for SAI, agricultural productivity growth in staple food crops cannot be compromised, as it is essential to eradicate poverty and hunger. SAI is an ongoing, iterative process that requires the increasing engagement of civil society, as well as public and private sector stakeholders. All stake- holders must be willing to take many small steps and continue learning and changing their behavior. Countries should expect to constantly adjust poli- cies to take advantage of new technologies and create incentives for farmers, technology develop- ers, and the investment community to develop new tools and solutions for SAI. While all opportunities for information and technology sharing among countries and regions should be encouraged, ulti- mately these tools and solutions must be locally tailored and context-specific. In particular, the domestic private sector, composed of millions of farmers and other local businesses, is by far the largest investor in agriculture. Programs and policies should encourage business develop- ment and public-private partnerships so that farm- ing and agribusinesses can provide even more social and economic development opportunities for rural communities. There must also be greater equity in access to land, inputs, and markets, especially for women and youth, who are key drivers of change. Multi-faceted approaches are needed to approp- riately and successfully respond to the diversity of farmers environments, objectives, constraints, and incentives. Integrating agriculture with other sectors such as health, natural resource management, disaster risk reduction, gender, education, and energy will also bring greater impact. In addition, accelerated progress on SAI will require better support systems on the ground, including more professional extension systems and greater access to mobile phone technology. It will also necessitate higher coverage and quality of data on soils and weather, as well as sharing of reference research and crop information. Biophysical, eco- nomic, social, and environmental metrics must be collected in a comprehensive, reliable manner to assess different policy and technology options and evaluate the performance of policies and programs  invest in increasing over time. Countries should adopt open data policies to generate more opportunities to share lessons learned. Countries must also the resilience of crop and livestock systems to potential shocks, adapting agriculture systems to climate changes, reducing water usage, improving nutrient management and animal health, and preventing further expansion of agriculture into natural eco- systems. Perhaps most important is that small-scale food production offers a direct route to ending hunger and malnutrition and reducing poverty. Food pro- ducers  especially those with land tenure  are an army of potential environmental stewards who can protect natural resources and ecosystem services better than any government or large company.1 Ulti- mately, people are the primary agents of change. Farmers, service providers, processors, marketers, and other local entrepreneurs must be central to the planning of any new solution.2 Designing solutions for concrete action Practical solutions for transforming global agri- cultural systems must address innovation, markets, people, and political leadership.3 These solutions should enable concrete action that works toward meeting one or more of the targets enumerated under the Sustainable Development Goals. Some solutions for early action will involve new technologies, business models, institutional mecha- nisms, and policies that can take place in any country and can be modeled elsewhere. Other solutions will be designed for a very specific context in response to local challenges. In either case, countries must be committed to implementing solu- tions themselves, with the support of other coun- tries and international agencies, and to engaging in information and technology sharing. Early solutions should focus on critical areas where improvements in crop, livestock, and fish product- ivity and natural resource management can be made relatively quickly. For example, significant gains can be realized by providing better seeds, incentivizing more efficient irrigation practices, and improving nutrient management. Equal weight should be given to solutions at the farm level and to 2  that improve post-harvest food chains landscape management; those through to the consumer. Examples of solutions for early action include: increasing access to new, stress-tolerant crop varieties and diversifying into more nutritious staple crop foods; implementing new models of agricultural extension; promoting better nutrient management, environmental stewardship, and integrated increasing access to micro-irrigation for smallholder farmers; strengthening livestock markets, promoting vacc- inations, and doubling animal productivity; imple- menting climate-smart agriculture; increasing resilience to pests and diseases; bringing inno- vative technologies to smallholder farmers to increase crop value, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve food safety; designing new business models for smallholder farming and marketing; and developing digital technologies for agricult- ural data collection and monitoring. Policy requirements for successful SAI While new technologies are important, policy and institutional reforms are equally necessary to align the incentives of producers and consumers and thereby drive the transformation of agriculture and food systems toward greater sustainability. Trans- parency, inclusiveness of all stakeholders, rigorous monitoring, regular review, and continuous adapta- tion to changing contexts will be key to the success of policies and of operational targets. Sharing policy experiences and aligning relevant policies across countries and regions will also help overcome barriers to developing and adopting new techno- logies. Critical policy areas to address include: agricultural trade and market access, agricultural financing, food processing and safety, consumer behavior, agriculture inputs and subsidies, land tenure, water rights and use, access to knowledge and techno- logy, rural labor, agricultural research and extension systems, protection and use of ecosystems, gender equity, rural education, and health. Where the poorest households spend a large share of their income on food, additional attention should be paid to stabilizing food prices and establishing or reinforcing social safety nets. Some countries will require substantial reforms in many areas. infrastructure and  is another Regulation important part of good governance, but it should be focused on specific areas such as protecting the poor, ensuring food safety, or protecting vulnerable natural resources like forests, water, and fish stocks. Investing in long-term change: science, techno- logy, people Accelerating the rate of progress in achieving SAI will require large, sustained investments in two major areas: agricultural research (with potentially high payoffs) and capacity building of National Agricultural Research Systems.4 The rates of return on investments in agricultural research and development are high in both developed and developing countries; spillover of innovations across countries is substantial, and such investments often have large, long-lasting cross-sectoral growth benefits.5 Therefore, invest- ments in public agricultural research should be doubled within the next ten years, and decisions should be made based on long-term and strategic thinking.6 Although private sector funding for R&D has been rising substantially, public sector funding must not be compromised, as it allows for increases in both basic and applied research and ensures wide, equal access to intellectual property.7 While international donors should be encouraged to invest more in both international and national agricultural R&D systems, most low- to middle-income countr- ies should aim to spend at least one percent of their agricultural GDP on public agricultural R&D. Private sector engagement in R&D can also be stimulated through results-based financial incen- tives that reward the creation and adoption of succ- essful agricultural innovations. Another important piece is removing barriers to innovation  such as a lack of recognition of intellectual property rights  that slow down the time or increase the cost of bringing a new technology to the market.8 Another essential piece is investing in creating and retaining a new generation of agricultural scientists and professionals  especially women  to develop new technologies, make sure they meet farmers and business needs, and turn them into applied tools. 3  Strong role of private sector and governments Strong political will is needed to implement a more coordinated and business approach to SAI. One major challenge will be the alignment of many different actors to ensure that strategic planning translates into real outputs to improve food security and nutrition for the rural and urban poor. Currently, while there are many stakeholders across sectors with common goals for agricultural development, there is relatively little coordination among them in most developing countries. Innovation Platforms have shown some success in fostering linkages between many actors to contri- bute to local innovation and stronger value chains. The range of actors with whom to coordinate includes national and local governments, agri- cultural research and extension systems, univer- sities, civil society organizations, businesses and industry associations, United Nations organizations, global and regional food and nutrition initiatives, business-led development initiatives, donors, international agricultural research centers, and other global and regional organizations. Partner mapping will be essential to leverage potential coordination and reduce duplication of services. Countries and international donors can also encourage and enable private sector investment in farming and food systems by strengthening infrastructure, providing security, reducing corrup- tion, protecting human rights, and promoting education. In the right environment, public-private investments can flourish as a means to implement solutions.

An  indicator  is  a  quantitative  metric  to  track  progress  towards  achieving  an  SDG  target.  Often,  multiple  indicators  are  used  for  each  target.   The  purpose  of  SDG  is  twofold.  Most  importantly, an indicator should be a management  tool, to help countries to stay on track to achieve  the SDGs.  Second, an indicator is a report card, to  measure progress and ensure the accountability of  governments to their citizens.  indicators  Without clear metrics through which to measure progress against the goals, and without accurate, consistent, and continuous data across both time and space, sustainable development will remain an amorphous goal. Metrics are needed to set base- lines against which to measure progress; track and predict socioeconomic, nutritional, and ecological change; understand constraints to sustainable development; work successfully with public, private, and NGO partners; and identify appropriate policy measures. Principles for good metrics for agriculture There are several key considerations in choosing metrics to monitor progress toward sustainable agricultural development. Primarily, metrics must be well defined, meaningful, measurable, motivational, and easy to understand and communicate to all stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, busi- ness executives, and consumers. A minimum set of universal indicators will provide broad, general information, to be supplemented with metrics that are tailored to national and local challenges. Because a central objective of sustainable development is to ensure social inclu- sion, metrics should also be disaggregated accor- ding to gender, geography, socioeconomic status, disability, ethnicity, age, and other dimensions wherever possible. There are infinite ways to measure progress toward sustainable development; therefore, there must be a conscious limiting of the number of metrics. Indi- cators should be chosen that are associated with well-tested methodologies and guidelines; proxies can be used that cover several areas of interest simultaneously. Moreover, there will be trade-offs between metrics in terms of precision, scale, and cost that will require a clear vision of measurement objectives at the start.1 Countries must be empowered and enabled to develop their own metrics and to collect and inter- pret their own data; moreover, engaging those who will ultimately use this data from the beginning will increase the chance of success. Metrics and the ways they are monitored and modeled can and should change over time as the relevant questions and challenges evolve.2 At the same time, metrics should make use of international and national data that is already available, where appropriate. Major data and data access gaps Many information gaps hamper the ability to assess the progress of sustainable agricultural develop- ment, including insufficient data, inconsistent guide- lines for measuring metrics, weaknesses in predict- ive models, and a lack of investment in new tech- nologies for monitoring systems. One major issue is how often data is collected and at what scale: average or aggregate national data that are 10 years old do not improve targeting of policy decisions and The Thematic Group is co-chaired by Achim Dobermann and Rebecca Nelson. Manager: Lauren Barredo. Editorial Consultant: Molly Slotznick. More information and full list of members available at unsdsn.org/thematicgroups/tg7  to include investments in the areas where they are most needed. Another issue is that while more and more actors  governments, international and regional organizations, agricultural research centers, private companies, etc.  are collecting data, there is often little coordination of activities or data sharing. Many currently used metrics and indicators are inadequate or conflict with each other; this obscures the ability of these metrics to inform clear paths of action for policymakers and practitioners. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating (and sometimes different definitions of) even basic measurements and models of crop yields, preva- lence and patterns of extreme poverty and food and nutrition insecurity, and the environmental impact of agriculture; therefore, misrepresentations and dis- tortions of the current state of affairs in agriculture and food systems are common.3 For example, aggregate national data on agricultural production, land use, food supplies, and poverty rates typically fail income distribution, agricultural waste, seasonal changes in production and con- sumption, exogenous shocks from weather or conflict, and market and climate uncertainties. Statistical capacities in many Sub-Saharan Africa countries are particularly dire.4 Moreover, there are large uncertainties around societal characteristics impact agricultural systems. These include future population growth, massive urbanization that reduces the availability of agricultural land, the numbers and locations of net producers and net consumers, and changes in diet preferences as social structures shift. For example, we do not know whether the worlds population will be nine or ten billion by 2050, but an extra one billion people has huge implications for additional food needs. On the demand side, policymakers need cross- sectional information that includes comparisons between different social groups, regions, and net producers vs. net consumers; information on long- term trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of production shocks on incomes and food con- sumption; and data on nutritional intake that include macro- and micronutrients over time (seasonal and year-to-year) and space (within- and between- countries). On the supply side, to improve market forecasts, early warning systems, and other solutions-oriented decisions, policymakers need accurate, high- that land degradation, resolution, transparent, and updated information on crop and livestock production, adoption of new technologies, fertilizer and pesticide use, availability of credit and machinery, water use and efficiency, labor, agrochemicals, diversity of crop and animal breeds, trade, end stocks, non-food uses of crops, food prices, and postharvest food losses and waste. Such data is currently not available for many countries due to constraints such as lack of human resources, technology, and funding. Information is also needed on the potential and actual trajectories for agricultural land development and exploitable productivity gaps. Fortunately, there has been some recent progress in gathering dis- aggregated data for a new Global Yield Gap Atlas (www.yieldgap.org), but more needs to be done to further refine the data at local levels.5 Long-term weather and soil data at high spatial resolution are among the most important for promo- ting Sustainable Agricultural Intensification (SAI) and should be of the highest priority to those concerned with food security, yet big gaps remain. High quality and high resolution data on soils and nutrients affect fertilizer usage, crop choice and manage- ment, and land development and rehabilitation strategies. New systems filling data gaps, like the Africa Soil Information Service (www.africasoils.net), still need more R&D support, appropriate business models for a more self-sustained operation, and greater reach to other regions of the world. There is also a need for a global nutrient monitoring system to help tailor nutrient management programs for greater productivity and efficiency and to more easily make progress toward sustainable develop- ment targets. Meanwhile, long-term and real-time climate data and modeling, at high spatial resolution, is required in all major crop-producing regions in order to define more appropriate and feasible local agriculture systems.6 New data initiatives and applications of digital agriculture We need to create a whole new global information system that is built on the principle of open data sharing and real-time learning to drive agricultural innovation. In fact, many of the real or perceived data gaps could likely be filled if existing information and methodologies were better aligned and more readily available to all. recommendations for 2  The systematic, reliable collection of data with which to track progress on sustainable develop- ment of agriculture and food systems will require significant investments to improve local, national, and global data collection and processing, including in related sectors like health, economics, and the environment. This investment should be supported by international agencies and official development assistance (ODA). Our ultimate ambition should be to monitor nearly every hectare of existing farmland within the next ten years. For this to happen, governments must embrace the era of digitally-enabled exchange of information and learning to accelerate the pace of development, democratize information, and empower farmers, consumers, and informed choices. To accomplish this, countries and regions should prioritize, customize, and commit to implementing different digital agriculture technologies, based on to make investors include geographic local relevance and feasibility, to collect new data that is highly disaggregated, easily sharable, and more transparent to foster accountability. Available technologies information systems (GIS), remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and numerous internet and smart- phone tools, such as mobile phone applications, social media, and crowdsourcing. Strong public- private partnerships will be necessarily to realize their full potential. As a fundamental priority, every country must maintain a regularly updated central register using baseline population and agricultural census data. Where applicable, governments should improve their capacity to collect data at farm and village levels. As such, national household surveys remain essential sources of information, but they should be simplified for easier, more reliable data collection on issues not captured by census and administrative records. Surveys also need to include more detail on key aspects of market and consumer behavior Examples of the applications of digital agriculture include;  National and sub-national scorecards that track key indicators related to food and nutrition security  High-resolution satellite imagery to support land tenure processes so farmers can confidently invest and the environmental sustainability of food systems to improve their land 3  Global Yield Gap Atlas or the Africa Soil Information Service  Digital data, maps, and spatial application services to create customized products, such as the  Data platforms to support simple but large-scale experiments by farmer research networks  Smartphone platforms to share location-specific crop status information, forecasts, and damage assessments, based on high-resolution, real-time satellite, cloud-based processing, weather data, and crop simulation models  Smartphones used for plant disease diagnosis or better nutrient management (e.g. NM Rice)  Video technology and monitoring platforms for farmer-to-farmer extension (e.g. Digital Green)  Mobile phone access to commodity exchanges and markets so farmers can secure higher prices; processors benefit from high quality raw material based on transparent standards and from easier aggregation of primary products  Mobile phone access to portals and services for extension professionals, farmers, and agribusinesses, including credit, inputs, weather-indexed insurance, location-specific extension alerts and technical support, market prices, and short-term weather forecasts Tracking of government performance in providing an enabling environment for SAI, including seed delivery, extension services, local businesses, and service providers for activities such as land preparation, planting, and application of pesticides Local value chain tracking and analysis to share information with businesses, governments, and consumers, increase value chain efficiencies, and track food safety and losses   Bioinformatics platforms to speed up gene discovery and breeding in both crops and livestock   Knowledge repositories and exchange platforms that enable information-sharing with partners to  Mobile platforms that provide integrated agriculture, health, financial and education services to rural increase the effectiveness and reach of sustainable development efforts families (e.g. MOTECH) species that account for the large cultural and economic differences within countries. Moreover, with the right technology, age census data can be linked to a countrys administrative records so that each individual record is automatically updated without the need for extra surveys. Other useful tools include composite indices that integrate and score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems; while these cannot replace the specific indicators needed to measure progress towards achieving targets and SDGs, they can be valuable additional sources of information and analysis for policymakers and for education. The vast amounts of data that would ideally be collected would feed into a well-designed and well- directed global monitoring network to track, antici- pate, and manage changes in the biophysical, economic, and social components of agriculture and food systems around the world.7 This system would allow scientists, farmers, and policymakers to find solutions to the most pressing problems facing food security; help direct public and private invest- ments in agriculture; allow for aspects of agriculture and food systems to be quantified and compared across time and space; and track progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. Universities and international agricultural research centers are well placed to play a major role in such an effort as they have thousands of experts and thousands of partners already on the ground to collect and utilize new data; there would also have to be a high level of coordination with national statistical agencies, UN agencies, and others who collect and analyze similar data. An interdisciplinary monitoring network would also provide unique, exciting opportunities for students and others to learn about the science and practice of sustainable agricultural development. Ultimately, all the SDGs should be supported by online, real-time, place-based, and highly disaggre- gated data. A transformation in monitoring progress toward the goals and targets related to agriculture and food systems will provide a model for all other areas of sustainable development.

Each will face distinct challenges and will have different priorities according to local agricultural, economic, social and cultural contexts. However, the process of setting specific, achievable targets with evidence-based indicators can help countries track their progress toward meeting the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local, national, regional and global levels. Defining Goals for Sustainable Agriculture Agriculture has the most direct impact on develop- ment aims related to poverty, food and nutrition security, rural development, natural resources and the environment, but it also indirectly affects many other sectors. Rather than define an SDG to encompass all agriculture-related issues, these development aims are significant enough to merit separate, specific goals or targets within goals. Extreme poverty and extreme hunger must be eradicated within the next generation. Eliminating this most basic form of human suffering is an urgent need of its own, and it is also fundamental to achieving all other progress toward sustainable development. Moreover, hunger and malnutrition fall under extreme poverty because all are challenges that affect rural and urban areas; hunger is not only a food availability; stunting and malnutrition are key dimensions of extreme poverty; and a single poverty/hunger goal ensures full continuity with the first Millennium Development Goal (Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger).1 Therefore, the SDSN proposes a stand-alone Goal 1, End extreme poverty, including hunger, inclu- ding key targets for agriculture. Sustainable development also requires a re-thinking of rural development and smallholder agriculture to bring greater benefits to the poor.

To address this need, the SDSN proposes Goal 6, Improve agriculture systems and raise rural prosperity, as a central goal in the new development agenda that provides an integrated approach for improving agricultural productivity and protecting the environment within the context of overall rural development. The Ten Sustainable Development Goals Proposed by the SDSN: 1. End extreme poverty including hunger* 2. Achieve development within planetary boundaries 3. Ensure effective learning for all children and youth for life and livelihood 4. Achieve gender equality, social inclusion, and human rights for all 5. Achieve health and wellbeing at all ages* 6.

More information and full list of members available at unsdsn.org/thematicgroups/tg7 Each goal should be an ambitious commitment that presents a single challenge with great impact. It should be universal, comprehensive, operational, and easy to understand. A target is a specific, measurable, attainable, time-bound outcome that contributes to the achievement of a goal. It should be defined at global and national levels to reflect each countrys ambitions and capacities. An indicator is a meaningful, simple, and quantifiable metric used to assess progress toward meeting a target. It should be easily and quickly measurable and should allow for disaggregation. related Both of these goals include targets related to food and nutrition security, as adequate and nutritious food is a universal human right. Particular attention is paid to the availability and quality of food during the first 1,000 days of life, as proper nutrition during this crucial period determines a childs mental and physical development for the rest of her life. Agriculture equally touches on and is influenced by each of the four dimensions of sustainable develop- ment: economic development, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and good governance.3 Indeed, agriculture is intimately tied to progress in many other areas of development, such as gender equality and social inclusion, health, climate change and energy, peace and security, disaster prevention and mitigation, ecosystem services, natural resour- ces and good governance. As such, six of the ten SDGs proposed by the SDSN include targets and indicators to sustainable agricultural development (see Figure 1). Key Considerations for Targets and Indicators Goals and targets for agriculture and food systems must encourage solutions to make food production, processing, trade and distribution more sustainable, equitable and resilient, thus also contributing to proper nutrition and other outcomes.4 They must also address the consequences of consumption in wealthier countries; when resources are scarce, priority must be given to the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, many of whom live in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture. The SDGs set aims for 2030. Yet the diversity and complexity of agriculture and food systems makes setting concrete targets for the next 15-20 years challenging. Moreover, major transformations in food systems will take time and involve many trade- offs that will affect the realistic potential of product- ivity and efficiency growth rates. Therefore, the targets and aspirational outcomes proposed by the SDSN for sustainable agricultural development should be viewed as a starting point that would in indicators will require themselves represent a major, welcome departure from the trajectories of the past five decades. With that in mind, targets should be achievable; they should be specified at the country or sub- national level wherever possible; and they should be defined such that decision-makers can be held accountable for progress made against them. In most cases, indicators should be outcome-oriented measures of success, i.e. tracking progress toward minimum quantitative results that could move over time according to what is acceptable and achiev- able in each country. These aspirational outcomes will differ among countries, depending on their starting points and their chosen development path- ways. Both indicators should be customized as much as possible so that each country can form tailored, practical solutions for meeting the SDGs. Tracking significantly improved data collection and greater investment in monitoring agriculture and food systems. At the same time, the availability of reliable data will determine which indicators can be used. Statistical agencies should promote the use of advanced and Goal 1: End extreme poverty including hunger Target 1a: End absolute income poverty and hunger, including achieving food security and appropriate nutrition, and ending child stunting Possible Indicators:  Proportion of population with income below $1.25 a  Proportion of population living below a countrys  Proportion of population below minimum level of  Share of calories from non-staple foods (%)  Prevalence of stunting in children under 5 (%)  Prevalence of anemia in non-pregnant women of Figure 1: Proposed Goal 1, Target 1a, & indicators. dietary energy consumption (%) reproductive age (%) targets and day (PPP) (%) poverty line (%)  2  indicators innovative data tools, including remote sensing, real-time monitoring with smartphones, crowd- sourcing, GIS mapping and other techniques. Building more reliable data systems that provide timely, disaggregated to measure progress at all levels (local, sub-national, national, regional, global) will be vital for success. Examples of Goals, Targets and Indicators Goal 1 reflects the four dimensions of food and nutrition security: supply, access, utilization and stability (see figure 1). The indicators under Target 1a address the major hunger and malnutrition problems that must be overcome in our generation. Anthropometric data on stunted children5 and dietary diversity indicators, which are powerful predictors of economic status and malnutrition, best measure true hunger.6 Stunting is a robust indicator of nutritional status and overall health, and it is linked to child mortality, delayed mental and physical development, and lower wages as an adult.5, 6 Anemia is linked to maternal mortality and other health risks, and is indicative of nutrient deficiencies and infections.6 To demonstrate the potential of Goal 1, each indicator is also linked to an aspirational outcome. Examples include: Goal 6: Improve agriculture systems and raise rural prosperity Target 6a: Ensure sustainable food production systems with high yields and high efficiency of water, nutrients, and energy, supporting nutritious diets with low food losses and waste Possible Indicators:  Cereal yield growth rate (% p.a.)  Crop yield gap (actual yield as % of yield potential)  Livestock and fish productivity growth  Full-chain nitrogen [phosphorus] use efficiency (%)  Crop nitrogen use efficiency (%)  Access to irrigation (%)  Crop water productivity (tons of harvested product per unit irrigation water)  Share of agricultural produce loss and food waste Target 6b: Halt forest and wetland conversion to agriculture, protect soil and land resources, and ensure that farming systems are resilient to climate change and disasters Possible Indicators:  Annual change in forest area (% p.a.)

GDP growth from agriculture is at least twice as effective at reducing poverty as growth from non-agricultural sectors.7 Therefore, Goal 6 that agricultural solutions for reducing poverty and increasing incomes must be nutrition- and equity- sensitive (see figure 2). This includes having a stable and affordable supply of diverse micronutrient dense foods and productivity growth that increases incomes and thereby access to more nutritious foods. Multi-sector interventions, such as those that address household food security and dietary diversity, are most efficient in reducing stunting.8 Different regions will face different challenges to achieve SAI: in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa it will be important to limit expansion of agricultural area, while in Asia, North America and  farmers  Employment rate of rural youth and women (%) future growth Europe more efficient resource management is fundamental. Generally, in crop production must come from existing land whenever possible by increasing yields and animal product- ivity and by reducing food loss and waste. Conser- vation policies, land-use planning and adequate governance, included protection of critical natural ecosystems is essential. Any slowdown in product- ivity growth means that more land, water, energy, fertilizer, pesticides, labor and other inputs will be needed to meet the rising food demand, thus also raising the cost of food.9 To achieve equitable, sustainable development, we must recognize the potential of rural areas. SAI is an engine of socially inclusive rural growth for small- holder farmers and rural businesses; it drives rural job creation, particularly for women and youth. Activities that increase access to markets, improved technologies and productive assets help rural communities escape poverty traps and move out of subsistence farming.10 For this to happen, govern- ments must invest more in rural transport, energy provision, irrigation, water supply, sanitation serv- ices, communication, and improved crop storage infrastructure. Aspirational outcomes for the indicators within Goal 6 include:  Post-harvest losses and food waste have been reduced by 30 percent by 2030  Annual yield growth rate of major food crops approaches or exceeds [1.5]% by 2020.  Crop nitrogen efficiency increased by [30]% relative to current levels in countries with low efficiency.   Water productivity of crop production has increased by [30]% in countries with high water use for irrigation. [0]% annual forest conversion to crop or livestock agriculture by 2030. [0]% net land degradation by 2030, i.e., achieve a land degradation neutral world  At least [80]% of all farmers have secure  ownership or affordable long-term leases of the land they farm.  At least 80 percent of rural households have access to good quality roads connecting them with local markets  All farmers have access to quality agricultural advisory services The SDGs and their targets provide opportunities to mobilize action to reverse or mitigate threats to food  production, particularly by increasing collaboration across sectors and stakeholders. The SDGs will require transnational cooperation, but all countries, both developed and developing, must take on the burden of responsibility for their success.

From providing basic sustenance and nutrition to employing farmers around the world, agriculture is a fundamental part of almost all societies and economies. Yet every year, more challenges arise that make agricultures primary objective, feeding the world, more difficult. Agricultural systems must adapt, even transform, to meet these challenges while becoming more eco- logically, economically and socially sustainable. This transformation is crucial for achieving many of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An agricultural transformation One-third of Earths land is devoted to agriculture, more than any other industry. Yet the agricultural sector struggles to keep up with a growing global population  a projected 9.3 billion by 2050  and an expanding middle class who wants more food and greater dietary diversity. Demographic and socioeconomic trends suggest a need to increase global food production by at least 60-70% by 2050; many developing countries may even have to double their food production1,2. In addition to the challenge of increased demand, the future of agriculture must contend with another challenge: reversing that current agricultural practices place on the environment, leading land degradation, water depletion, pollution, unbalanced nutrient cycles, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and threats to bio- diversity. Climate variability and climate change are complicating factors that will likely exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition in areas already suffering from poverty and hunger3. Maximizing agricultures potential to reduce rural poverty is another difficult challenge, particularly in the pressure to farm productivity, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where progress toward this goal has been limited. Farm sizes shrink as populations grow, and inequalities in land tenure and access to resources are pervasive. Efforts to increase improve access to markets, and subsidize inputs may even contribute to inequalities by favoring farmers with greater access to resources and capital. Reducing rural poverty requires long-term agricultural and eco- nomic growth that accounts for the needs of the poor, including creating new job opportunities for people in rural areas. Societies must also leverage agriculture to meet health and nutrition goals, for example, through crop diversification and higher food quality. More than 840 million people are still chronically undernourished4. Two billion people face hidden hunger, micronutrient deficiencies inhibit mental and physical development. Stunting, an irreversible form of undernutrition, affects 165 million children. On the other hand, overweight and obesity are growing phenomena that take huge tolls on health and societies5. Devising long-lasting solutions to these and many other challenges will require deep, structural transformations In developing countries, the agricultural sector must adapt new technologies and business models to increase job opportunities, overcome resource constraints, enable greater market participation, and reduce inequalities, particularly for women. Agriculture in developed countries must also change to address urgent issues such as unhealthy diets, food waste, biofuel production, and policies that impact low- and middle-income countries.

Without new strategies, commitment, and coordination of the agriculture and food sector, many countries will also forgo opportunities for broad-based, self-sustaining development driven by governments and the private sector. Rethinking smallholder agriculture Each year an additional 10-15 million young people look for jobs in rural areas of South Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa. This presents a great opportunity for vibrant rural development: these young workers can ignite the structural transformation presented above so farmers can see sustained and sustainable growth in productivity. Smallholder farms are a crucial part of national food systems and economies, and they will play a large role in the sustainable food systems of the future. However, without a shift in how these farms work, many rural communities will continue to be left behind. Unlike farmers with large holdings, small- that smallholder farmers holders may lack capital and other resources, legal rights that allow them to invest in new technologies, access to markets, and access to agricultural extension services6. Female smallholder face even greater barriers to success, despite the fact that they comprise half of smallholder farmers in East and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Fortun- ately, women are a source of great potential for the future of agriculture: with access to the same inputs, women often produce yields 20-30 percent greater than men7. They must be empowered and encouraged. Other shifts in smallholder agriculture can also improve productivity, profitability, and sustainability. Increasing the share of rural household income that comes from non-farm sources will act as an insurance policy against environmental and econ- omic shocks by spreading risk and reducing reliance on one source of income, ultimately reducing poverty and increasing food security. One source of non-farm income is small-scale, rural food processing plants, which could also help reduce food loss and increase food quality, for both safety and nutrition.  2  Investments in rural infrastructure, especially roads, electrification, and telecommunications are ess- ential to increase access to markets, reduce food loss, and improve storage and handling. Good governance is key to ensuring fair access to re- sources, markets, and new technologies. Strength- ening farmers entrepreneurial and management skills increases farm value and reduces threats to productivity and profitability. As countries urbanize and fewer people are available to work on labor-intensive small farms, other options include consolidating farms or farm services and increasing mechanization to improve efficiency8. Ultimately, for many farmers and their families, the best way forward is to move out of farming as better opportunities arise. Major elements of sustainable agriculture and food systems A new global the sustainable development of agriculture and food systems is essential to increase food availability and utilization, improve human health, create more prosperous rural communities, and mend and rejuvenate the environment. Solutions must address population framework for growth, food consumption, food production, and food loss. One significant element of a sustainable food system is a change toward healthier diets and less food waste and loss. More people in rich and poor countries are eating greater amounts of energy- dense, processed and refined foods, which can be detrimental to health and require more resources to produce. While accounting for cultural consider- ations, dietary behaviors need to be reformed for both health and environmental sustainability. Meanwhile, as much as one-third of all food grown may be lost or wasted along the way from farm to fork9. Unfortunately, it is unclear how much food loss and waste can realistically be reduced, and we do not know whether recovered food would reach those in need. More data on food loss and waste is urgently needed to guide future action. Addressing the new challenges of food supply and demand will require a Sustainable Agricultural Intensification (SAI) in farms around the world10. This means producing sufficient nutritious food through higher yields rather than area expansion; ensuring food is accessible to all; preventing damage to Figure 2. Enhancing system productivity and value is the entry point for enabling farmers to enter a virtuous circle of sustainable agricultural production and livelihood.   3  that are natural resources and biodiversity; respecting and protecting the health and wellbeing of people, animals, and the environment; and maintaining these principles now and in the future. Simply: SAI aims to reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture while meeting all its other social and economic goals. It requires tailored strategies and solutions integral components of accelerating economic and social development in rural areas. SAI is also a core requirement for the broader implementation of a \"climate-smart agriculture\", which unites the goals of the agriculture, develop- ment, and climate change communities11. The practical implications of climate-smart agriculture are still being debated, as difficult trade-offs undoubtedly exist between activities to intensify agricultural production, mitigate risks, and adapt to climate-induced shocks. Diverse pathways to sustainable development Transformative changes in agriculture and food systems are needed in all countries, but the priorities and timing of implementation will differ according to each local agricultural, economic, social, and cultural context. Every community will face different challenges and barriers to sustainable development, as well as different past successes. Simplistic, universal prescriptions or recommend- dations will not work; instead, successful models are built on flexibility and local knowledge. Fortunately, the principles of SAI can be applied to any food production system. Sustainable agriculture cans be achieved for farms of different sizes and degrees of market integration and will particularly benefit resource-limited, smallholder farms. focus on Without oversimplifying, action must raising resource the diversity, productivity, efficiency, resilience to shocks, value, quality, and the overall profitability of farming. We need to provide farmers, agricultural professionals, agri- businesses, scientists, and local policy makers with the necessary information, resources, tools, and recognition, as well as the space to meaningfully cooperate. In short, to achieve sustainable development we must accelerate the dynamic evolution of agri- culture and entire food systems. This is the only way rural communities will move out of perpetual poverty toward long-term prosperity and the only  way we will see long-term, stable global food and nutrition security. It is also one of the few key pathways to rehabilitate the environment for a healthier planet. There is no practical alternative.

This  report  shows  the  multi-faceted  contributions  of  the  global  food  system  to  all  pillars  of  sustainable  development  in  the  post-2015  era.  It  recognizes  the  need  to  eradicate  poverty  and  hunger  in  our  generation,  and  it  also  points  out  the  importance  of  having  an  integrated  agricultural  and  rural  development  goal  in  the  sustainable development agenda.   The report aims to outline principles for developing more specific solutions that are adaptable to local  realities. Perhaps the only commonality of agricultural systems worldwide is that they provide that most  critical  resource,  food.  Beyond  this,  agricultural  systems  are  incredibly  diverse,  with  crops,  livestock,  climates, soils, tools, and technology varying from country to country and even farm to farm. Therefore,  we have tried our best to avoid generic prescriptions of any kind. One-size-fits-all solutions are unlikely  to  work  and  solutions  will  need  to  be  tailored  to  address  regional  and  site-specific  barriers  to  sustainability. This adaptation process will require the engagement of diverse stakeholders and sectors.  Our  objective  is  to  advance  the  process  of  setting  global,  science-based  goals  and  targets.  The  SDGs,  targets, indicators, and solutions we propose are meant to be examples to spur further discussion. They  will  require  validation  and  tailoring  of  concrete  strategies  in  each  country.  We  encourage  all  stakeholders  to  participate  actively  in  further  efforts  to  define  the  post-2015  agenda,  and  in  taking  action to advance sustainability.   This  report  has  benefitted  from  substantial  input  from  many  people,  including  the  members  of  the  Thematic  Group  and  hundreds  of  suggestions  received  from  experts  representing  all  sectors  of  agriculture and food systems. The authors have inevitably brought their biases to the document, and  perhaps  focused  primarily  on  science  and  technology  solutions.  We  recognize  that  many  other  areas  may not have received due attention, including strategies for reforming agriculture and food systems in  industrialized countries, biofuels, agricultural policies and trade, food aid, land tenure, financing, farm  insurance,  alternative  agriculture,  counterfeit  farm  inputs,  fisheries,  agroforestry,  environmental  and  health issues of agrochemicals, and ecosystem services management, to name a few.    To  many,  entering  a  sustainable  development  path  for  agriculture  and  food  seems  like  a  daunting  challenge. We believe that it is feasible. The overarching motive for this report is to encourage people to  act, despite the enormous challenges, or as John F. Kennedy said:    \"By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all people to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly towards it.\" vi    What are some of the tough questions that need to be addressed?   How can we make farming more profitable and more sustainable in our generation?   How can consumer behavior be changed towards healthier diets and wasting less food? Will aspiring  consumers in Asia follow the same food consumption model as in the West?    Will China import more food and thus also water, nutrients and energy from other countries? How  can it transform its own agriculture to produce enough food in a sustainable and safe manner?    How  can  India  direct  more  of  its  economic  growth  towards  rural  development  and  eradicating  widespread poverty and malnutrition?    How  can  Africa  utilize  its  land  and  water  resources  better?  What  will  be  the  role  of  large-scale  commercial agriculture development compared to smallholder production?    What  will  be  the  future  role  of  Latin  American  countries  that  still  have  arable  land  and  water  resources that could be tapped? What should be produced there? How?    How can the double poverty trap of small farms with poor soils be overcome? Will rural development  and job creation require more consolidation of farms into greater sizes or business entities that could  be more productive and sustainable?   How can agriculture become an attractive entrepreneurial undertaking, reducing drudgery, reducing  unemployment, and getting people - women and youth in particular - decent and fulfilling work?   How can biotechnology best contribute to future food and nutritional security and serve the needs of  the poor?    To  what  extent  can  agroecological  principles  be  harnessed  in  soil,  plant  and  pest  management,  to  substitute for and/or improve the efficiency of external inputs?      How much can organic agriculture contribute to feeding the world? Where and at what cost?    How much can urban farming contribute to feeding the world? Where and at what cost?   How can we capitalize on the revolutions in genomics, IT, physics, biology, chemistry, and material  sciences to take agriculture to a new level? Who will invest in strategic blue-sky research?    How can countries make the best choices for a sustainable agriculture development path and what  should be the role foreign aid in it? How can we ensure that investments are motivated by facts and  priority needs rather than political interests?   How  should  current  global,  regional,  and  national  policies  on  subsidies  and  trade  be  changed  to  enable equitable and sustainable agricultural development?   How  can  we  improve  the  business  climate  to  encourage  more  investment  and  small  business  development?  What  new  mechanisms  and  incentives  can  be  provided  for  public,  civil  society  and  private sector actors to work more effectively together?   What could be new, more effective models for agricultural extension?    What should be the future investment models for agricultural research and development?   Do  current  agreements  and  laws  on  plant  genetic  resources  and  other  intellectual  property  serve  future needs? How can we ensure that intellectual property is honored but also accessible to poorer  countries as well as small- and medium-sized businesses?   What  are  the  concrete  targets  and  metrics  for  measuring  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  and  food sector? How can they be monitored at a disaggregated level?       vii  Summary Agriculture faces many challenges, making it more and more difficult to achieve its primary objective -  feeding the world  each year. Population growth and changes in diet associated with rising incomes  drive  greater  demand  for  food  and  other  agricultural  products,  while  global  food  systems  are  increasingly  threatened  by  land  degradation,  climate  change,  and  other  stressors.  Uncertainties  exist  about  regional  and  local  impacts  of  climate  change,  but  the  overall  global  pattern  suggests  that  the  stability of the food system will be at greater risk due to short-term variability in food supply.   Agriculture must change to meet the rising demand, to contribute more effectively to the reduction of  poverty  and  malnutrition,  and  to  become  ecologically  more  sustainable.  This  transformation  will  be  crucial for achieving many of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poverty and hunger  must  be  eradicated  in  our  generation  and  should  therefore  be  a  prominent  stand-alone  goal.  The  majority of the worlds poor people live in rural areas, and agriculture growth has proven effective in  lifting rural families out of poverty and hunger. Managing the linkages between agriculture, poverty and  nutrition  is  critical  as  we  look  towards  providing  children  with  an  opportunity  to  reach  their  full  potential.  The  new  agenda  should  also  have  a  goal  that  explicitly  focuses  on  improving  agricultural  systems and addresses rural development in an integrated manner, as underscored also by the interim  report of the Open Working Group. Food and nutrition security targets are fully embedded in these two  goals. The contributions of agriculture to goals on gender equality and social inclusion, health, climate  change  and  energy,  ecosystem  services  and  natural  resources,  and  good  governance  must  also  be  recognized in specific targets and indicators for these goals.   Sustainable Agricultural Intensification (SAI)a offers workable options to eradicate poverty and hunger  while  improving  the  environmental  performance  of  agriculture,  but  requires  transformative,  simultaneous  interventions  along  the  whole  food  chain,  from  production  to  consumption.  It  also  requires unprecedented, large-scale behavior change by consumers as well as producers of food. Major  elements of a sustainable development path for agriculture and food systems are:   Shifting towards healthier diets;   Ensuring the supply of safe, nutritious food to all through increasing agricultural productivity on  existing crop and pasture land and making it more resilient to climatic extremes;   Preserving  the  environment  through  systems  management  principles  that  increase  resource  efficiency,  reduce  net  carbon  emissions  and  other  pollutants  associated  with  agriculture,  and  improve soils and conserve natural resources;   Reducing food losses and waste;    New visions and business models for smallholder agriculture and rural development that create  economic and job opportunities and make rural areas more attractive places to live;    Empowering women along the value chain;   Coherent  policies  at  all  levels  that  stimulate  behavior  change,  align  all  actors,  provide  secure  rights  to  land  and  other  resources,  and  incentivize  solutions  for  sustainable  intensification  of  agriculture and food systems that take advantage of rapid advances in science and technology.   Clear  goals,  targets  and  indicators  that  address  critical  areas  of  food  production  and  consumption,  motivate  people  and  provide  a  structured  approach  to  guide  countries  in  designing their own development paths for agriculture;                                                               a Sustainable Agricultural Intensification (SAI) includes the application of genetic, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic  viii     Monitoring agriculture and food systems at unprecedented level of detail;   Long-term vision and investments in capacity building and research.  A key principle to recognize is that - given the huge diversity of agriculture and of the starting points for  change - there can be no one-size-fits-all solutions. Countries should follow the most suitable pathways  and timelines for addressing their specific challenges through tailored SAI solutions, policies, monitoring  and other implementation mechanisms. Solutions are workable options that can be tailored to raising  system  productivity  or  diversity,  efficiency,  resilience,  value  and  profitability  of  farming,  including  the  enabling mechanisms needed within diverse local contexts. Advances towards SAI will be most effective  and durable where all stakeholders work together to bring their ideas and support to developing and  implementing  site-specific  solutions  that  allow  for  iterative,  continuous  improvement  of  the  world's  food systems and their key components.  Long-lasting solutions will require re-thinking of rural development and smallholder agriculture towards  structural  transformations  that  include  and  benefit  the  poor.  Improved  farming  systems  and  new  technologies and business models can create decent jobs, allow the overcoming of resource constraints,  enable  greater  market  participation,  and  also  lessen  physical  hardships  in  agriculture,  particularly  for  women and youth. Agriculture in industrialized countries will also need to change, including changes in  policies  that  affect  many  low-  and  medium-income  countries.  High-income  countries  will  have  to  embark  on  a  pathway  that  addresses  urgent  issues  such  as  unhealthy  diets,  food  waste,  the  right  balance of food vs. biofuels production, and fair agricultural policies. These countries will also have to  lead  in  demonstrating  how  higher  standards  of  productivity,  resource  efficiency,  food  safety  and  traceability,  and  environmental  impact  can  be  met.  This  can  also  provide  important  lessons  for  developing countries in terms of technologies and policies to consider.  New technologies will make it possible for sustainable agriculture to become the new global standard,  not the exception; the main factors resisting change are political will, lack of policy coherence at many  levels, financing, governance and human behavior. Many of the solutions needed are known or could,  with wise investments, become available in the next 10-20 years. Early action is important, but more  support and better mechanisms are needed for long-term thinking and action, including strengthening  public research and development (R&D), human resources development, and institutional change. We  propose  evidence-based  indicators  that  could  be  applied  to  track  progress  towards  meeting  the  new  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their Targets, at local, national, regional and global scales.  Their  effective  use  will  require  investing  more  in  monitoring  agriculture  and  food  systems,  taking  advantage of rapid advances in digital information technologies.  The transformation of agriculture will also require re-thinking of international and national structures.  The  global  food  system  should  morph  into  a  true  global  partnership  that  widely  shares  information,  experiences and new technology, following open access principles and practices that honor intellectual  property  but  enable  wide  access  and  use.  Otherwise  progress  in  implementing  SAI  will  be  slow,  and  consequently  goals  and  targets  for  sustainable  development  will  not  be  met  in  many  countries.  New  models  for  implementation  are  needed  that  unlock  the  real  potential  of  farmers,  public  and  private  sectors in solving complex problems. The private sector will be a key player in sustainable agriculture  and  food  systems.  Good  governance  will  be  essential,  including  supporting  farmer  groups,  managing  risks, and deploying tools and accountability measures that foster greater private sector investment in  agriculture, but also put clear constraints on unsustainable or inequitable exploitation of land, water,  forests and fisheries.     ix  1. Agriculture is at the center of sustainable development 1.1. Challenge domains for agriculture and food  Agricultureb -  the  supplier  of  that  basic  human  need,  nutrition  -  is  the  worlds  largest  user  of  land,  occupying  more  than  one  third  of  Earths  terrestrial  surface  and  also  using  vast  amounts  of  water.  It  affects  our  daily  life  in  many  ways,  both  directly  and  indirectly.  Humans  expect  agriculture  to  supply  sufficient  nutrients,  economically  and  culturally  valued  foods,  fibers  and  other  products.  Agriculture  must also provide desirable employment and optimized land use and productivity in relation to limiting  resources.  It  must  coexist  with  the  needs  of  urban  and  natural  environments,  landscapes  and  a  wide  range  of  other  ecosystem  services.  Agriculture  is  essential  for  inclusive  development  because  it  produces food as well as economic wealth for many of the world's poorest people  wealth that allows  for  improved  livelihoods  through  better  health  care,  education,  infrastructure  improvements  and  greater  investment  in  environmentally  sound  practices.  For  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  growth  generated  by  agriculture is eleven times more effective in reducing poverty than GDP growth in any other sectors1.   The development of agriculture was essential for the rise and survival of early civilizations2. Increases in  the worlds population from 800 million at the start of the industrial revolution in 1790 to just over 7  billion today and the prospect that the human population will grow to around 9.3 billion in 2050 have  created  new  concerns  about  our  ability  to  feed  the  world  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  agricultural  community has had tremendous success in increasing food production over the past five decades and  making  food  more  affordable  for  the  majority  of  the  worlds  population,  despite  a  doubling  in  population.  Global  production  of  main  grains  such  as  rice,  wheat  and  maize  has  roughly  tripled  since  1960, resulting in corresponding decreases in food prices3. New estimates show that investments in crop  improvement that led to unprecedented yield increases during the Green Revolution saved an estimated  18-27 million hectares of natural ecosystems from being converted to agriculture4. The transformation  of agriculture benefited from technological innovations and inexpensive fossil fuels to raise agricultural  productivity in many world regions, but also left others behind, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa5.    Progress has been made in reducing global hunger (protein-energy malnutrition) from about 1 billion  people in 1990-1992 (18.6% of total population) to about 870 millionc in 2010-2012 (12.5%)6. Yet, global  progress in reducing hunger has varied greatly by region and has slowed since 2007. Further, the effects  of recent food price spikes relative to household incomes and economic opportunities have not yet been  fully  accounted  for,  food  prices  are  expected  to  remain  high,  and  hidden  hunger  (micronutrient  deficiencies)  and  other  forms  of  malnutrition  remain  widespread  or  have  emerged.  Many  countries,  particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, still face major food and distribution gaps7. Unacceptably, every day  more than 8,000 children die from undernutrition, despite unprecedented global growth in wealth and  technology.   About 70% of the worlds very poor people live in rural areas, and a large proportion of the poor and  hungry  are  children  and  young  people8.  This  figure  is  higher  in  South  and  Southeast  Asia  and  Sub- Saharan Africa, where three quarters of the poor live in rural areas. The prevalence of rural poverty is a                                                               b Agriculture refers broadly to the cultivation of animals, plants and other life forms for the production of food, fiber, biofuels,  raw materials, drugs and others purposes, including aquaculture and agroforestry.  c FAO projections. This includes 304 million people in South Asia, 234 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 167 million in Eastern Asia,  65 million in Southeast Asia, and 42 million in Latin America. In Asia and the Pacific the number of undernourished people  decreased from 723 million to 528 million during the past two decades, whereas in Africa and the Near East it increased from  192 million to 275 million6. Data quality is uncertain for many countries.  1  challenge that can be met by improving agricultural performance, improving market access and reducing  the risks faced by farmers, and investing in rural infrastructure and enterprise.  Meeting world food demand conflicts with current trends of increasing competition for land, water and  other  natural  resources  by  non-agricultural  sectors9,  and  needs  to  be  accomplished  under  a  more  extreme and also more uncertain future climate in many parts of the world. For many countries, coping  with  water  scarcity  and  building  resilienced for  adaptation  to  climate  change  in  the  agriculture  sector  have become top priorities10. Reducing agricultures environmental footprint while ensuring global food  and  nutritional  security11  will  be  especially  difficult  as  87%  of  the  population  in  2050  will  live  in  the  presently developing world, including 27% in least developed countries. This is the portion of the worlds  population for which economic growth will be highest and for which increasing incomes will also shift  dietary patterns towards increasing demand for food. This is also where there will be increased pressure  on  many  ecosystem  services,  especially  in  the  tropics.  In  the  past  two  centuries,  27%  of  the  worlds  tropical forests, 45% of temperate forests, 50% of the savannahs and 70% of natural grasslands have  been  converted  to  agriculture12,  with  agriculture  being  the  major  driver  for  deforestation  worldwide,  leading to the large share of GHG emissions attributed to the sector13.   Crop  intensification  has  enabled  increases  in  food  production  and  labor  productivity  without  putting  more  land  under  cultivation,  but  this  often  comes  at  a  price,  such  as  land  degradation  through  soil  erosion,  inappropriate  irrigation  and  land  management  practices,  loss  of  soil  organic  matter  and  nutrients, depletion of freshwater resources, pollution of waterways and marine environments through  inappropriate use of nutrients and crop protection products, increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,  and  reduction  in  biodiversity  and  ecological  resilience  through  dependence  on  a  reduced  number  of  species and varieties. If the environmental costs involved were properly accounted for, the real costs of  producing food would be much higher. Is it feasible to continue with a consumption model that largely  treats natural resources such as soil, water, and air as free goods?  Crop and animal production systems are hugely diverse. A good framework is needed to identify entry  points  that  can  lead  to  the  desired  outcomes  of  reducing  poverty,  improving  food  security  from  household to global scale, enhancing population nutritional and health status, and reducing agricultures  environmental footprint. Such a framework must consider the trade-offs and outcomes explicitly, across  different  scales.  To  identify  entry  points  for  action,  three  challenge  domains  are  identified  as:  (1)  Sustainable intensification of agricultural systems for food security with high resource use efficiency and  environmental protection, (2) Poverty alleviation, economic and social rural development, and (3) Food  systems for nutritional security and better health.   Sustainable intensification of agricultural systems for food security and environmental protection   High  food  prices  slow  down  economic  growth14.  After  decades  of  decline,  food  prices  began  to  rise  slowly in the early 2000s and more sharply after 2005 (Fig. 1-1). Since a spike in 2008, commodity prices  have  fluctuated,  reflecting  a  different  market  context  for  agricultural  products  than  prevailed  for  the  previous  half  century.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  commonly  used  food  price  indices  have  shortcomings  because  they  measure  prices  against  the  earning  power  of  populations  which  have  experienced substantial economic and income growth, and thus do not represent the conditions of the  poorest and most food insecure members of global society15.                                                               dResilience is the ability of agricultural systems and communities to recover successfully from adverse shocks through the  capacity for adaptation and transformation. It involves being able to adapt to a changing and increasingly unpredictable  environment, and the ability to learn from disturbance. In agriculture, a production system should be resilient and contribute  to increased production of food or other products over time.   2  Current US$ Constant 2005 US$ 300 250 200 150 100 50 ) 0 0 1 = 5 0 0 2 ( x e d n i e c i r P 0 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010  Figure 1-1.

Supply  and  demand  balances  for  agricultural  products  have  become  tighter.  Global  food  demand  will  continue to increase for at least another 50 years due to increasing population and changes of diet. A  rapidly  expanding  middle  class  in  transition  countries  is  expected  to  further  increase  the  demand  for  fruits,  vegetables,  livestock  products  (milk,  meat  and  eggs)  and  fish,  but  generally  also  for  more  processed, packaged and branded food. While economic growth will generally lead to an improvement  in  nutrition  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  both  rural  and  urban  food  and  nutrition  insecurity  remain  challenges  because  of  rising  numbers  of  people  with  low  and  unstable  incomes  living  in  settlements with inadequate infrastructure, including inadequate access to food16. In many developing  countries, urban and rural households that are net buyers of food often spend half of their income on  food, have limited means to store it, are exposed to natural disasters and disease epidemics, and are  also the most vulnerable to shocks.  It  is  difficult  to  make  accurate  predictions  of  future  demand  for  food  and  other  agricultural  products  because consumption depends on demographic trends, economic growth, behavioral choices and policy  decisions, i.e., to what extent countries and their citizens commit to a sustainable development path. If  recent  trends  in  population  and  per-capita  wealth  continue,  feeding  a  world  population  of  about  9  billion people in 2050 would require raising aggregate global food production by at least 60-70%. Many  developing countries may have to even double their food production to nourish their rapidly growing  populations17,18. It is likely that the demand growth for cereals will be less than demand growth for food  in the aggregate, but one can also imagine a scenario in which both cereal and livestock production may  have to double within that period if meat consumption and bioenergy use of crops accelerate19. Under  such a scenario, it will be difficult to meet simultaneously the goals on eradicating poverty and hunger  while also safeguarding the environment (Annex 1).  On  the  positive  side,  annual  growth  in  global  agricultural  output  has  remained  fairly  steady  at  2.1  to  2.5%  over  the  past  five  decades  (Fig.  1-2).  The  contribution  of  technological  change  to  agricultural  3  productivity, measured as total factor productivity (TFP)e, has shown a remarkable increase, from less  than 0.5% annual growth in the 1960s to greater than 1.8% annual growth in the 2001-2009 decade. In  other  words,  TFP  growth  accounted  for  three-fourths  of  the  total  growth  in  global  agricultural  production during the past decade, outpacing area expansion and input intensification as the primary  source  of  growth  in  world  agriculture5.  However,  TFP  growth  has  been  uneven  worldwide.  Countries  with strong investments in agriculture, including strong research and development (R&D) capacity (e.g.,  China  and  Brazil),  have  demonstrated  high  productivity  growth.  By  contrast,  growth  has  slowed  elsewhere and remains slow in many food-insecure countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) has replaced resource expansion and input  intensification as the primary source of growth in world agriculture. The total height of the bar is the  average annual gross rate in gross agricultural output over the period, which is partitioned into the four  components shown. Source: Fuglie et al.5  Indicators such as crop yield or partial factor productivities of land, water, fertilizer, and labor show a  less encouraging global picture20. Declining freshwater resources, rising energy prices, or low efficiency  of nitrogen fertilizer affect many former Green Revolution regions21. Recognizing that each country has  different staple crops that form the basis for food and nutritional security, a major global concern is the  slowing yield growth in cereal crops, particularly rice and wheat that are the basis of food security in  many parts of the world9,22. During the 1989-2008 period global yield growth rates have averaged 1.6%  for maize, 1.0% for rice, 0.9% for wheat and 1.3% for soybean, which is insufficient for meeting future  food  demand  without  having  to  convert  a  lot  more  land  into  agriculture23.  For  comparison,  doubling  yields over the next 40 years would require annual yield growth rates of more than 1.7%.  Farm yields are approaching their economic upper limits in highly productive areas. In major irrigated  wheat, rice, and maize systems, yields appear to be near 80% of the yield potential, with little evidence  for having exceeded this threshold to date24,25. Further genetic improvement of crop yield potential is                                                               e Total factor productivity is the productivity of all inputs taken together. It compares growth in all inputs (land, labor, capital,  material inputs) with growth in total output of crop and livestock products. It is mainly a measure of technological efficiency  and does not account for agricultures effects on the environment.    4  difficult and will take decades rather than years to be achieved9,26. On the other hand, many improved  agronomic practices can still lead to higher yields and/or higher efficiencies and greater sustainability in  many farming systems. Rainfed farmers, for example, appear to have relatively large yield gaps (50% or  more) that persist largely for agronomic, economic and social reasons24. There is also strong evidence  for  decreasing  crop  yield  growth  due  to  rising  temperatures  and  uncertainty  in  growing  season  weather27.  More  broadly,  climate  change  will  affect  agriculture  in  many  ways,  requiring  substantial  investments in designing and implementing climate-smart food systems (Box 1-1).  Box 1-1. Climate change and agriculture  At present our  world is 0.8C  above  pre-industrial  levels  of  the  18th century. At  current trends 2C  warming  could be reached within one generation. Globally, warmer temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea  water levels, increased frequency and perhaps also severity of extreme weather, and ocean acidification are  likely  to  cause  greater  short-term  variability  in  the  food  supply  and  have  long-term  consequences  for  agriculture and food systems. The potential impact is less clear at regional or national scales, but the available  evidence indicates that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition in the  areas that already suffer most from poverty and hunger and are also most vulnerable to extreme weather at  present28.  Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are particularly prone to productivity losses from climate change  because  major  staples  in these  regions are often  already  grown  above  their optimum  temperature,  with  as  much as 10% yield loss for +1C of warming predicted in some locations27. Climate change thus directly affects  the food and nutrition security of millions of people, potentially undermining progress towards a world without  poverty and hunger. It is likely that food inequalities will increase, from local to global levels. Food access and  utilization will also be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food  utilization  could  be  impaired  by  loss  of  access  to  drinking  water  and  damage  to  health.  The  impact  of  past  greenhouse  gas  emissions  cannot  be  reversed  in  the  next  few  decades.  There  is  need  for  considerable,  immediate  investment  in  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions  that  address  climate  change  impacts  on  all  dimensions  of  food  and  nutrition  security.  Each  country  needs  to  have  a  clear  climate  change  strategy  for  agriculture,  including  strong  commitment  to  near-term  adaptation  measures.  Many  technology,  policy  and  governance  interventions  must  be  integrated  to  move  towards  a  \"climate-smart\"  agriculture  (CSA)28,29.  The  whole  food  system  needs  to  adjust  to  climate  change,  with  strong  attention  also  to  trade,  stocks,  and  to  nutrition and social policy options. Despite a massive research literature, much remains unknown about many  direct and indirect food security impacts of climate change, including human and agro-ecological dimensions.  To  enable  countries  to plan  and  act  will  also  require significant improvements of  data, models and decision  tools used for projecting climate change and its impact on agriculture, and for supporting real-time action on  the ground30-32.   In densely populated world regions land and water are becoming scarce resources in agriculture. How  much  more  fertile  agricultural  land  will  be  lost  to  urbanization  and  industrialization  in  rural  areas  is  difficult to predict. It is safe to assume that those trends will continue in many countries, thus increasing  the pressure to produce more from the remaining land. Various forms of land degradation already affect  about  20%  of  all  cultivated  land  and  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  living  there,  often  coinciding  with  areas  of  extreme  poverty33.  Soil  erosion,  drought,  salinization,  waterlogging,  desertification  and  other  forms  of  land  degradation  have  spread  widely  in  the  past  30  years,  particularly  threatening  ecosystems and agriculture in arid and semi-arid environments. Economic losses associated with land  degradation have recently been estimated at US$ 490 billion per year, or 5% of total agricultural gross  domestic product (GDP)34.   Current  predictions  indicate  that  less  water  may  be  available  and  more  droughts  may  occur  in  the  coming decades35. The world is currently using some 6000 cubic kilometers of fresh water per year, 70%  of which goes to agriculture, mostly in Asia (Fig. 1-3)36. In dryland regions such as the Middle East and  Northern Africa water use in agriculture can reach up to 90% of the available water. Considering that  40% of world food production comes from irrigated systems on only about 20% of the arable land area,  5  more  investments  in  improving  water  productivity  in  existing  schemes  and  safely  expanding  irrigated  agriculture will be needed for long-term food security, but with a strong emphasis on policies and new  freshwater  resources37,38.  technologies  that  ensure  maximum  efficiency  and  protect  critical  Unsustainable depletion of aquifers has become a major concern in some of the largest food-producing  and -consuming countries (China, India, USA), but there are also many aquifers worldwide that could still  handle  further  expansion  of  irrigation39.  During  the  Green  Revolution  in  Asia  contributions  from  expansion of irrigated area were at least as large as those from improved varieties, fertilizers and other  intensification measures. It is unlikely that Sub-Saharan Africa can achieve a much higher level of food  security  and  sovereignty  without  more  irrigated  agriculture.  Integrated  solutions will  need  to  balance  the  use  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  resources  by  different  sectors40,  while  increasing  water  productivity in the whole food system. For example, consuming less water can also be achieved through  wasting  less  food,  consuming  less  water-intensive  food,  and  improving  water  use  efficiency  in  crop- livestock systems as a whole, from forage production to meat consumption.

In  Sub-Saharan  Africa  in  particular,  continuous cultivation without such fertilizer leads to widespread soil nutrient mining and traps people  in  poverty42.  Such  regional  imbalances  and  different  contexts  need  to  be  addressed  in  defining  successful  strategies  for  better  nutrient  management.  Increasing  sustainability  will  demand  a  push  towards both access to fertilizers and greater efficiency in nutrient use. Significant opportunities exist to  increase nutrient use efficiency and thus also reduce GHG emissions through full life cycle approaches in  the  contexts  of  integrated  use  of  both  organic  and  inorganic  fertilizers43.  Globalization  of  the  food  system  has  also  created  massive  nutrient  and  virtual  water  flows  of  traded  agricultural  commodities  across regions, which also need to be considered when developing new solutions for sustainable use of  nutrients and water resources44. The nutrients imported are commonly concentrated in cities, creating  waste disposal problems rather than alleviating deficiencies in rural soils.  Some  17  billion  animals  in  the  world  utilize  substantial  amounts  of  natural  resources,  mostly  in  the  developing world, where most of the growth of the sector will occur45. Common global concerns about  intensive  livestock  production  include  overgrazing,  costs  and  environmental  consequences  of  global  trade of feed and meat, pollution due to livestock waste, transmission of diseases, animal welfare and   6  large emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly methane. The productivity and nutritional services of  extensive  livestock  systems  will  need  to  be  boosted  substantially  in  many  regions,  including  crop- livestock systems that enable better utilization of the available resources45. Grasslands occupy 40% of  the worlds land surface (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) and support extensive nomadic as well as  in  positive  outcomes  for  grasslands,  the  environment,  and  households46.  Pastoral  communities  are  intensified  livestock-production  systems.  Nearly  1  billion  people  living  on  less  than  2  dollars  a  day  in  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa keep livestock. For many, these animals are their most valuable asset  and  income  source.  Many  grazing  lands  are  in  a  degraded  state,  particularly  in  marginal  areas  of  developing  countries,  affecting  productivity,  household  incomes  and  environmental  services  such  as  hydrology, biodiversity, and carbon cycles. Grassland management practices can be optimized to result  among the most marginalized, living in remote areas with poor infrastructure and communication. They  often lack access to markets and input supplies and are dependent on their animals to support them.  The  development  challenge  for  these  communities  is  how  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  and  increase  their  resilience  in  the  face  of  external  shocks  such  as  drought,  which  can  devastate  their  herds  and  livelihoods. Both short and longer term interventions are required for these areas, including rangeland  and herd management, early warning systems, social safety nets, livestock insurance programs, timely  disaster responses, better education and ensuring political stability47,48.   Fish are a rich and often cheap source of protein and nutrients for the poor. Aquacultures contribution  to fish supply for human consumption will soon exceed that of wild capture fisheries. Aquaculture has  grown at record pace in recent years and it has been a major factor in annual fish consumption reaching  an  average  of  18.6  kg  per  person  in  201149.  Growth  is  driven  by  increasing  demand  from  a  growing  urban  middle  class  as  well  as  by  technological  changes  that  have  increased  productivity  and  lowered  prices  and  volatility.  However,  for  countries  most  dependent  on  fish  to  meet  the  nutritional  requirements of their population, wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier, particularly for  the poor. FAO - mainly relying on the opinions of regional experts - estimated that about 30% of world  fish  stocks  were  overexploited,  depleted,  or  recovering  in  200949.  Inadequate  reporting  in  official  statistics of the small-scale fishing sector in developing countries likely leads to underestimates of global  marine and freshwater catches. Others have estimated that 80% of global stocks of over 500 fish species  are fully or over-exploited50. Although not all fisheries are in crisis, securing the sustainability of global  fisheries is essential and requires innovative efforts across a broad spectrum of fishery systems51.   Poverty alleviation, economic and social rural development  The first MDG of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger was in many ways the most ambitious and the  most  difficult  to  define  in  terms  of  implementation  strategies.  The  goal  of  halving  the  proportion  of  people whose income is less than $1.25 a day was met five years ahead of schedule, primarily due to the  extraordinary  economic  growth  rates  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  and  the  associated  structural  transformation of those economies. Progress in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa was limited and most  of  the  billion  people  who  remain  below  the  poverty  line  live  in  rural  areas  in  those  two  regions.  Reducing  rural  poverty  still  remains  one  of  the  more  difficult  development  challenges  because  it  requires  sustained,  socially  inclusive  economic  growth,  particularly  in  the  agricultural  sector.  Clear  strategies  to  generate  broad  agricultural  growth  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  are  needed.  Farm  sizes  are  shrinking due to population increase as well as current land tenure systems in densely populated areas,  while there is continued reliance on area expansion where populations are sparse. Reliance on market  mechanisms only may contribute to inequality in rural income distribution, as efforts to increase farm  productivity, improve access to markets, and subsidize inputs may favor farmers with sufficient land and  capital resources. Other policies can contribute to inequality by favoring those with legal tenure over  7  those  without,  male  farmers  over  female,  ethnic  majorities  over  minorities  or  nomadic  peoples,  and  farmers living closer to population centers and markets over those living in the most rural areas.    In South Asia rural poverty tends to be concentrated in lagging areas that have not been integrated into  the  larger  economic  growth  process.  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  particularly  in  countries  that  lack  major  mineral resources, the agricultural sector is the largest employer and contributes significantly to overall  economic growth. Between 2010 and 2050 the rural population in East Asia is expected to decline by  50% and by 10% in South Asia, but is likely to increase by about 30% in Sub-Saharan Africa52. Annually,  some 10-15 million young people will be looking for jobs in these rural areas. Although this increases the  pressure on natural and social resources, it is also an opportunity for vibrant rural development. Igniting  a  structural  transformation  towards  sustained  and  sustainable  growth  in  smallholder  productivity  in  Sub-Saharan Africa remains one of the dominant development challenges into the medium-term future.   Rural  households  in  many  countries  obtain  half  or  more  of  their  income  from  non-farm  sources.  Facilitating the diversification of off-farm income sources for rural people will play an important role in  building  resilience  and  food  security  for  rural  families.  Policy  support  for  the  establishment  of  small- scale food processing industries in rural areas could contribute to reduced losses, increased food quality,  smoothing of consumption and the reduction of drudgery.  Small farming businesses are hugely important for the sustainable food systems of the future, but many  of them are left behind because, unlike large farms, they lack land resources and other capital or have  poor  access  to  markets  and  functioning  extension  services,  even  in  many  industrialized  countries53.  Some  1  to  2  billion  people  live  on  land  for  which  they  have  no  legal  title,  preventing  them  from  obtaining  credit  and  investing  in  productivity-enhancing  measures8.  Female  smallholder  farmers  comprise  about  50%  of  smallholders  in  Eastern  and  Southeastern  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  They  typically face more challenges than their male counterparts, but they represent a huge, underutilized  potential. It has been shown that women farmers who have the same access to productive resources as  men could increase yields on their farms by 20-30%54.   The trends of rapid urbanization and the vanishing rural labor pool have huge implications for the future  of small-holder systems in which abundant labor is needed for field work, tending livestock and nutrient  recycling55. New  models  for  consolidation  of  farms  or  farm  operations  and  services  will  be  needed  in  many areas, also to allow for greater mechanization.  Broad investments in rural infrastructure, inclusive  entrepreneurship models, strengthening of local capacity to customize best management practices, and  other social innovations are needed to transfer more value to smallholder farmers, minimize risk, and  provide a safe operating environment for them.  Food systems for nutritional security and better health  Achieving food and nutritional security requires every member of society to have access to nutritious  food and the information and freedom to make appropriate choices concerning good nutrition. Progress  has  been  made  in  reducing  undernourishment,  underweight,  child  stunting,  child  mortality,  and  micronutrient deficiencies. But progress has varied among countries and setbacks are common due to  volatile  food  prices,  conflicts  and  natural  disasters.  Currently,  about  870  million  people  (12.5%)  are  chronically undernourished in terms of energy intake and about 2 billion people suffer from vitamin and  mineral  deficiencies6,56.  Malnutritionf   resulting  in  fetal  growth  restriction,  underweight,  stunting,                                                               f Malnutrition = an imbalance between nutrient intake and nutrient needs for an active, healthy life, which may involve over- or  under-nutrition by a variety of conditioning factors. Undernutrition = insufficient nutrients for an active, healthy life, often  observed during gestation and infancy and among adolescent girls and women whose specific nutritional needs are least likely  to be met by the family diet.    8  wasting, and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc and suboptimum breastfeeding causes more than 3  million child deaths annually (or 45% of all child deaths in 2011)57. Stunting has surpassed underweight  as  the  most  prevalent  nutritional  challenge,  affecting  165  million  children  worldwide,  or  one  in  4  children  under  the  age  of  five57,58. Overcoming  malnutrition  during  the  first  1000  days  of  life,  from  conception until age 2, is among the most critical interventions needed, for which agricultural strategies  can provide solutions.  The  growing  new  challenge  is  that  two  thirds  of  the  world's  population  live  in  countries  where  overweight  and  obesity  kill  more  people  than  underweight.  Some  1.4  billion  adults  and  40  million  children  under  the  age  of  five  are  overweight,  including  500  million  who  are  obese59.  Maternal  and  childhood overweight and obesity are becoming an increasingly important contributor to adult obesity,  diabetes, and non-communicable diseases57. Inequalities are increasing within countries, requiring new  policies  to  address  both  overweight  and  undernourishment  at  the  national  level.  In  rapidly  growing  countries  such  as  China  or  India  a  wealthy,  urban,  and  more  obese  population  coexists  with  a  poor,  rural, undernourished one. Multiple forms of malnutrition may occur in the same families or individuals.  Those  that  are  undernourished  often  have  insufficient  resources  to  make  food  choices  and  are  often  also  in  a  situation  where  there  are  environmental  disasters  or  social  unrest  and  thus  unable  to  gain  access to sufficient, quality food. Those that are overweight often have more resources but make poor  food choices, leading to obesity and the associated non-communicable diseases which can put a very  heavy  load  on  medical  and  support  services.  A  new  phenomenon  is  that  people  may  be  exposed  to  deficient diets in early life but are at heightened risk of becoming overweight later in life57.  Generally speaking, people who are fed properly are healthier, but nutritional and health linkages differ  widely. For example, the stunting and wasting of under five children which is widespread in rural areas  of  South  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa  is  an  entirely  different  problem  than  the  increasing  obesity  or  concerns about food quality and safety in rapidly urbanizing populations. It is broadly accepted that an  adequate  and  balanced  diet  provided  through  effective  agricultural  production  results  in  healthier  children and communities. The relationship between agriculture and nutritional outcomes is mediated  by  access  to  food,  womens  and  youth  education,  cultural  habits,  health  status  and  the  health  and  sanitation  interventions  that  allow  vulnerable  children  to  take  advantage  of  dietary  improvements.  Systematic efforts to explore these linkages are still rare and the results are not always clear60.   Needs for dietary changes for improved health and nutrition vary. In most low-income countries modest  increases  in  consumption  of  animal  source  foods  can  contribute  substantially  to  ensuring  dietary  adequacy, preventing undernourishment and improving nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, if  high-income countries continue to consume more meat and sugar and middle income countries follow a  similar path, health risks as well as pressure to grow more crops for animal production would increase to  levels  that  could  be  difficult  to  manage.  Horticulture,  on  the  other  hand,  is  likely  to  make  a  positive  contribution to nutrition via income and diversified consumption in all countries.  Agriculture-health  linkages  also  include  food-borne  and  animal-transmitted  diseases  or  water-  and  vector-borne  communicable  diseases  related  to  the  management  of  agroecosystems.  Mycotoxins  -  substances naturally produced by molds and microfungi that are capable of causing disease and death in  humans and animalsg - have emerged as a major global concern61,62. High levels of mycotoxin infections  are mostly caused by stress on the plant grown in the field, delayed harvest and poor storage of grains,  thus also resulting in negative economic impact for farmers. Moreover, in less developed countries more                                                               g For information on mycotoxins see www.knowmycotoxins.com  9  than 10% of the infectious disease burden is due to zoonosesh, and the majority of them are transmitted  to people from livestock hosts through consumption of animal source foods, vectors or direct contact45.  The  growing  densities  of  human  and  livestock  populations,  especially  in  South  and  East  Asia,  are  increasing the probability of new zoonotic diseases63. Agricultural intensification and/or environmental  change are associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an  expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment64.   1.2. Risks under a Business-As-Usual scenario  In  the  absence  of  change  towards  a  new,  shared  global  framework  for  sustainable  development  of  agriculture and food systems, a Business-As-Usual (BAU) trajectory would have severe implications for  food and nutritional security, economic and social development, public health as well as environmental  sustainability. In a scenario of continuing current trends world cereal production would increase by 52%  from 2010 to 2050, whereas world meat production rises by 64% (Annex 1)65. Although positive efforts  are already underway in some regions and countries, they are not sufficient yet to enter a sustainable  development path for agriculture. Some countries will be less negatively affected than others under a  BAU scenario, but the vast majority will be worse off (Table 1-1; Box 1-2).   Table 1-1.

Examples of major risks that could arise in the BAU scenario  Food and nutritional security   High food prices will put a drag on economic growth.   Agricultural productivity growth and access to food will be insufficient to eradicate extreme hunger and  nutritional deficiencies in a growing population by 2030 or even 2050.    Volatile food markets and prices, and little ability to absorb supply shocks caused by climatic extremes,  natural disasters, economic constraints, political unrest, and competition with biofuels.   Many countries will continue to have unexploited yield and efficiency gaps and rely heavily on food aid  and imports.    Continued large food losses and waste; eroding public trust due to frequent food quality scandals and  diseases caused by unsafe processing and handling of food.   An excessive focus on staple productivity exacerbates the problem of micronutrient deficiency.  Persisting malnutrition in mothers results in the next generation not being able to fulfill its human  potential.  Increasing  obesity  problems  due  to  unhealthy  diets  and  emergence  of  numerous  associated  health  problems.   Economic and social development    Agricultural  productivity  growth  will  not  be  sufficient  to  eradicate  rural  and  urban  poverty.  Due  to  volatile food prices, tens of millions of people will swing between being lifted out of poverty and being  thrown back into it.   Social,  economic,  and  political  stability  is  at  risk  due  to  large  regional,  national,  and  within-country  nutritional and food distribution gaps as well as competition for natural resources.      People  and  countries  may  fight  over  land,  water,  and  some  mineral  nutrient  resources,  particularly  countries that do not own such resources.   Smallholder  farmers  and  local  agricultural  businesses  will  continue  to  lack  access  to  markets  and  financial resources, and thus are not able to overcome the poverty traps associated with small holdings  and/or  poor  soils.  They  will  be  unable  to  benefit  from  new  technology.  Farming  families  will  be  left  behind in the economic and social development taking place in urban areas.    Gender asymmetry in access to assets and economic services continues.    Farmland prices will rise, making it difficult for young people to enter farming.   Lack of roads, clean water and electricity will continue to make it impossible to significantly improve the  lives of the rural poor.   Youth unemployment in rural areas will further rise. More young people will leave the countryside and  move to the city, accelerating urbanization.     A less mobile, aging workforce will be left behind in the villages.   Environmental sustainability          Global fertilizer production will increase by another 40-50% by 2050 to feed the growing population and  its dietary lifestyle. If not managed correctly, the increase in fertilizer production may have unwanted  environmental impacts.   Faster  depletion  of  water  resources  used  by  agriculture  may  lead  to  reduced  access  and/or  higher  prices.  More forest, wetlands and other land could be converted to agriculture, further increasing greenhouse  gas emissions.  Degradation  of  existing  agricultural  land  may  increase  further.  Soils  in  developing  countries  would  become even more depleted of carbon and nutrients, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Excessive  or  otherwise  inappropriate  use  of  agrochemicals  in  agricultural  systems  could  cause  more  water pollution and loss of species diversity, particularly of insects and their food webs.  Unsustainable depletion of many fish stocks will continue.  Declining  diversity  and  species  habitat  quality  in  agricultural  landscapes  could  reduce  ecological  resilience and increase the vulnerability of agriculture, particularly in fragile environments.  Progress in sustainability reporting and stewardship system development by a variety of stakeholders  will continue, but at a relatively slow pace.    11  In  many  countries,  a  BAU  scenario  would  also  mean  a  continuation  of  dependence  on  foreign  aid  investments in agriculture as opposed to governments and private sector making their own investments  and policy reforms that create an enabling environment for broad-based economic development. Lack  of  long-term  strategy,  commitment  and  coordination  would  continue  to  dominate  investments  in  agricultural research and development, slowing progress in much-needed innovations.   The BAU scenario is clearly not a sustainable development path because food prices would rise further,  poverty and hunger could not be eradicated, poor food choices in both rich and poor countries would  continue,  and  environmental  pollution,  loss  of  forests  and  biodiversity,  and  degradation  of  land  and  other natural  resources would accelerate even further.  Many countries would not be able to achieve  their economic and social development goals (Box 1-3).   Box 1-3. The role of the smallholder in the structural transformation of Kenyan agriculture and economy   Kenya is poised to embark on a sustained economic growth path of at least 5% per annum that could move it  into the status of a middle income country within 20 years. The locus of the economy will shift from its agrarian  roots  to  one  that  is  more  urbanized,  industrial  and  service-based.  Kenyan  economic  development  faces  a  number of challenges, many of which have their origin in the health of the smallholder farm economy. Kenya  has rapidly urbanized, from less than 9% in the 1960-70 period to over 20% at present. Over half of the urban  population is absorbed  in informal employment  and  settlements. Despite two decades of growth, structural  adjustment and poverty reduction plans, rural poverty rates have remained consistently high at over 40%, with  significant  regional  differences.  About  80%  of  agricultural  production  comes  from  Kenyas  2.9  million  smallholders, yet only 30% of them are net sellers of maize, whereas 10% of larger farms account for 75% of  maize  marketable  surplus.  Farm productivity  is increasing  but it  is not  sufficient  to improve  incomes  and  in  several high population density regions farm size is now limiting sustainable intensification.   Balanced structural transformation of the economy is dependent on a number of processes driving structural  change of the agricultural sector, namely (1) increasing marketable surpluses through formal supply chains, (2)  rising land and labor productivity in agriculture, (3) rural livelihood specialization, in which agriculture becomes  the key economic activity of fewer, more professionally managed farming households, (4) the development of  efficient input and output markets, and (5) eventually an increasing average farm size. Kenyan agriculture is far  from achieving these outcomes and is particularly constrained by declining farm size, in many areas below an  asset base that will allow a realistic pathway out of  poverty. At the same time smallholder  farming systems  themselves must intensify, often with significant change in the mix of production activities, farm management,  and  improved  market  integration.  Structural  transformation  thus  involves  change  at  three  different  levels,  namely  the  flow  of  goods,  labor  and  investment  capital  in  the  overall  economy;  the  change  in  markets,  institutions, infrastructure, and supply chains within the agricultural sector itself; and the response at the level  of the farming system as it intensifies and engages increasingly in the market.    Although, compared to the BAU scenario, any scenario of accelerated productivity growth would help  with reducing poverty and hunger, productivity and efficiency increases alone will not be sufficient to  achieve all of the targets of sustainable agriculture and food systems, including better environmental  stewardship, protection of natural resources, and healthier human beings. More radical transformations  of food systems will be required, but without neglecting the basic need for broad productivity growth as  the fundamental driver for eradicating poverty and hunger.     12  2. Towards a sustainable development path for agriculture and food systems Population and income growth are the major drivers for agriculture.  A sustainable development path  will require decisive and ultimately transformative changes of the global agriculture and food system to  increase food availability and utilization, improve the environment, make human beings healthier, and  create more prosperous rural communities. Although opinions may differ about the specific solutions to  pursue,  a  consensus  is  emerging  that  measures  to  be  taken  must  address  food  demand,  production,  consumption and losses3,6,9,11,11,17,19,19,20,66-75. Management of population growth, food losses and waste  will  be  important  for  reducing  the  pressure  on  agricultural  land,  water  and  natural  ecosystems,  in  addition  to  increases  in  agricultural  productivity  and  efficiency  and  measures  to  protect  natural  resources from unsustainable exploitation, degradation or pollution11,66,76.   Transformative changes of agriculture and food systems are needed in all countries, but the priorities  differ. Eradicating poverty and hunger and accelerating rural development are the highest priorities in  low-income countries. Both require broad-based agricultural productivity gains. More generally, broad  global  productivity  growth  is  important  for  keeping  world  food  prices  low  enough  to  combat  poverty and hunger, but also to curb food and bioenergy-driven expansion of agriculture into natural  ecosystems.  Future  growth  in  food  production  needs  to  be  decoupled  from  recent  trajectories  of  inefficient  and  unsustainable  use  of  primary  resources.i This  will  require  increasing  the  efficiency  of  complete  food  chains  and  changing  the  behavior  of  all  actors  involved,  including  policy  makers,  businesses,  consumers  and  farmers.  The  consumption  models  that  have  dominated  economic  development  in  richer  countries  during  the  past  five  decades  also  need  to  change77.  Food  safety  standards need to be raised for major food production and processing chains worldwidej, but also in live  animal and wet food markets of many developing countries.   Many interventions are needed, but due to different starting points and many barriers that need to be  overcome not all can be implemented in the same order of priority and at the same speed everywhere.  Changing diets towards healthier, less resource-intensive foods and reducing food waste are likely to be  difficult and uneven processes. The priority on the supply side is to increase production on existing crop  land.  This  can  be  achieved  by  closing  yield  and  efficiency  gaps  and,  where  possible,  diversifying  and  increasing  the  number  of  crops  grown  per  year,  as  well  as  reducing  pre-  and  post-harvest  losses.  Although there is still suitable land that can be developed for agriculture, a fundamental question is how  much of that land should be taken under cultivation or whether future food demand can be entirely met  without bringing more land under cultivation. For livestock, the challenge is to increase productivity per  animal through better feeding, effective animal breeding and livestock health care, and where possible  shifting to more efficient animals, such as from cattle to poultry and fish or small ruminants.   The transition to sustainable development pathways for agriculture will require all stakeholders in the  food system to adapt and adopt state of the art knowledge and technologies, and it will require trying  multiple models. Ideological battles over whether it is right or wrong to eat meat or whether agriculture  should  be  conventional,  GM,  or  organic  can  lead  to  inconsistent  and  inefficient  outcomes,  particularly when local contexts are ignored in sweeping campaign rhetoric. To feed and green the world                                                               i Decoupling means an increase in the use efficiency of primary resources and reduction in pollution as agricultural growth  proceeds, through a combination of new technologies, policies and economic incentives for individuals, businesses, and  governments.  j See www.who.int/foodsafety/en for an overview of the key issues and measures.  13  is  driven  by  the  interaction  of  demographic  and  economic  change.  means to support the dynamic evolution of farming systems more strongly by providing farmers with  necessary  information,  inputs,  and  recognition.  There  is  no  revolutionary  alternative.  Proposals  to  transform  agriculture  to  low-input  and  organic  systems  would,  because  of  lower  productivity,  exacerbate the global food and nutrition security challenge78.  Farms of different sizes and commercial orientation coexist in any location, and further differentiation  over  time  In  terms  of  commercialization, while many hinterland farms continue to face high transaction costs and therefore  remain largely self-sufficient, farms closer to markets are becoming increasingly specialized and linked  to agribusinesses55.  In terms of farm size, the momentum of population growth will continue to drive  declining total land area per farm across Africa for many more years, with corresponding reduction in  natural resources available per farm family. The land available per farm will continue to shrink until non- farm opportunities expand enough to absorb all new workers entering the labor force. Asia as a whole  has already passed this turning point so its average farm sizes can rise, compounding the opportunities  afforded  by  increased  commercialization55.  The  resulting  interlinked  transformations  of  the  agrifood  system  from  urbanization  include  changing  diets,  food  markets,  rural  factor  markets  and  agricultural  technologies as well as farm size79. While recognizing the huge importance and potential of smallholder  farming  for  current  and  future  agriculture80,  we  also  have  to  accept  that  for  many  small  farmers  and  their families the best roadmap for development is to move out of farming. Non-farm rural and urban  employment opportunities will drive this process. For those who remain in farming this will provide new  opportunities to increase productivity and income, and use resources more efficiently.    These  trends  have  huge  implications  for  agricultural  policies,  rural  development,  and  research.  The  world needs to concentrate its efforts on science-based, actionable solutions that are tailored to local  situations and support structural transformations of the whole food system. New business models for  farming  and  new  approaches  for  providing  access  to  modern  agricultural  technology  to  all  farms  at  different scales are needed to ensure a sustainable development path. Good governance and support  mechanisms  must  ensure  fair  access  to  resources,  new  markets  and  innovative  technologies.  Policy  makers, scientists, agricultural professionals from all sectors and farmers need to be equipped with the  right knowledge and information. Basic education and vocational training will play an important role. It  is only through education that we can provide every child the chance to escape poverty in rural areas,  and that we can change the behavior of food consumers towards healthier diets, less food waste and a  greater understanding and acceptance of agriculture and new technologies.   2.1. Reducing food losses and waste and shifting to healthier diets  Healthier dietsk and less food loss and waste must be integral components of future sustainable food  systems.  Given  the  diversity  of  causes  involved,  solutions  for  that  need  to  be  flexible,  targeted,  and  applied in a local context, with strong government leadership at all levels as well as participation by all  key  actors  along  the  food  chain,  including  the  food  industry.  Greater  coordination  among  agriculture  and health extension workers would be beneficial.                                                                k A healthy diet provides nutrients in the proportions needed for bodily function and development, with sufficient quantities of  essential nutrients and limited exposure to harmful substances. Nutrient needs vary over time and across people, and include  adequate fluid and total calories, protein and fats, as well as a range of vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients. These  needs can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, in proportions tailored to each person's activity levels  and developmental circumstances.   14  Urbanization, the commercialization of food systems and the globalization of food trade have changed  the way food is supplied and consumed. The movement towards increased consumption of simple and  refined carbohydrates and excessive saturated and trans fats is causing a decline of dietary diversity81  and  health  among  the  poor  and  rich  alike82.  These  foods  also  have  a  higher  energy  intensity  during  production, leading to increased consumption of land, water, energy and nutrient resources41. Shifting  to plant-based protein and more diverse diets would be beneficial for human health and resource use  efficiency in many regions, but there are important exceptions to consider. Ingrained cultural patterns  related to the consumption of animal products, fat, salt, and refined foods, for example, necessitate a  nuanced approach to the pursuit of healthier diets.  For example, in fragile regions the most sustainable  way  of  farming  and  livelihood  is  through  grazing  animals  and  consumption  of  their  products.  Hence,  intervention  strategies  need  to  be  based  on  culturally-variable  definitions  of  what  is  considered  healthy. In many countries they will require focusing on inappropriate quantities and quality of our  food choices, compounded by other unhealthful lifestyle choices. In other countries they will have to  also address other issues, including improving the traditional farming systems to enable healthier diets.   It has been estimated that - on fresh weight basis - as much as one third of all food grownl, some 1.3  billion tons per year, may be lost or wasted83,84. When converted into calories, this means that about  one out of every four calories grown is not ultimately consumed by humans85. The economic value of  food losses in affluent countries appears to be in the range of 0.5 to 1% of GDP, but in many developing  countries, where food forms 20-40% of GDP, the food loss equates to 7-15% of GDP41. Environmentally,  food  loss  and  waste  inflict  a  host  of  impacts,  including  unnecessary  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  a  waste of water and land resources85.   Crop losses are often associated with the earlier stages of the food chain (i.e., pre-harvest, harvest and  postharvest  losses),  whereas  food  waste  mainly  occurs  at  the  market,  retail  and  consumer  ends.  Decreases in food and nutritional quality due to poor harvest, storage and processing also negatively  affect the income realized by sellers and health of consumers. In developing countries, ineffective pest  and disease management, poor harvest practices, poor storage facilities and inadequate infrastructure  mean  that  large  losses  occur  during  and  after  harvest    between  farm  and  market.  In  developed  countries,  and  increasingly  in  developing  countries,  there  are  substantial  losses  in  the  processing,  packing, and distribution stages, compounded by legislated due date restrictions, and also waste in the  home  and  restaurants.  The  latter  is  increasingly  becoming  a  problem  in  developing  countries,  particularly in urban areas. Food distribution and consumer behavior play a major role; information and  awareness is needed as well as better technologies to manage food marketing.  By  how  much  food  losses  and  waste  can  realistically  be  reduced  remains  unknown.  There  is  also  no  evidence that if the food loss was prevented, those who need more food the most would have access to  the  rescued  food.  Nonetheless,  for  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  smallholder  farmers  who  are  substantially  self-provisioning  and  market  their  surpluses,  reducing  their  losses  would  increase  consumption and income. As a general strategy, developing countries should increase their investments  in reducing postharvest losses, whereas developed countries should create entities devoted to reducing  food waste85.   The task of tackling the problem of food loss and waste is also bedeviled by lack of data. Historically,  given  the  technologies  and  methods  available,  the  cost  of  measurement  has  tended  to  exceed  the  benefits  of  obtaining  those  measurements.  FAO  has  only  recently  started  to  assess  food  losses  and                                                               l FAO estimates global losses (on fresh weight basis) of about 30% for cereals; 10% for oilseeds and pulses; 40-60% for root and  tuber crops, fruits and vegetables; and 20% for meat, dairy, and fish. However, the quality of the underlying data is generally  uncertain. Actual losses vary widely and are likely to be lower in many food production systems.  15  waste  by  region  and  food  type.  This  work  is  important  because  once  countries,  companies  and  individuals know both the extent of food waste and location in the value chain it is easier to identify and  take  steps  to  address  the  problem.  The  degree  of  financial  loss  caused  by  food  waste  needs  to  be  communicated clearly to all stakeholders, including consumers. The food system is unlikely to grow less  complex.  Therefore,  innovative  new  techniques  and  methods  need  to  be  aggressively  developed  to  know  how  much  food  loss  and  waste  can  realistically  be  prevented.  Digital  technologies  have  many  applications in postharvest loss and food waste tracking and prevention, and will also serve to deepen  actor  and  stakeholder  understanding  of  the  complex  nature  of  the  supply  chain.  With  this  understanding,  interventions  can  be  carefully  assessed  and  targeted  to  ensure  losses  are  prevented  sustainably and effectively.  Many  successful  interventions  would  require  substantial  investments  in  infrastructure  and  improved  technology.  Reductions  of  postharvest  losses  often  require  significant  capital  investment  to  improve  storage and transportation systems. However, many less costly technologies can also help reduce losses  at  different  stages  of  the  food  chain,  including  packaging  for  portion  control  at  pre-consumer  stage;  breeding  crops  with  longer  shelf  life;  using  micronutrient-enriched  fertilizers  with  boron,  known  to  prolong  the  shelf  life  of  fruits  and  vegetables;  improving  harvest  practices;  and  low-cost  drying  and  hermetic storage solutions.   2.2. Producing more food through sustainable agricultural intensification   A  consensus  is  emerging  that  addressing  the  new  challenges  requires  a  Sustainable  Agricultural  Intensification (SAI)m in small and large farms throughout the world86-89. A simple operational definition  of the objective of SAI is to provide sufficient, accessible, nutritious food, while enabling economic and  social development in rural areas and treating people, animals and the environment with respect. Key  premises of SAI include89:   The need to produce more food, and more nutritious food.   Increased production primarily through higher yields, to limit conversion of forest, wetlands or  grasslands to agriculture.   Re-thinking and transformative changes of food systems to achieve greater resilience and major  reductions in environmental impact.  Formulation of context-specific strategies and solutions for SAI that are integral components of  accelerating economic and social development in rural areas.   In practical terms, this primarily means to deliver more product (food and other agricultural goods) per  unit of resource, whilst preventing damage to natural resources and ecosystem services that underpin  human  health  and  wellbeing  both  now  and  in  the  future76.  Depending  on  the  context,  improved  performance may mean any or all of the following: increased profitability and productivity (agricultural  outputs  such  as  food,  feed,  fiber,  and  biofuels),  high  efficiency  and  returns  from  external  inputs,  improved  crop  and  livestock  yield  stability,  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  enhanced  ecological                                                               m Sustainable agricultural intensification is the efficient production of safe, high quality agricultural products, in a way that  protects and improves the natural environment, the social and economic conditions of farmers, their employees and local  communities, and safeguards the health and welfare of all farmed species (www.saiplatform.org). SAI is an evolving concept  and definitions of it vary. Other terms proposed in the literature include, for example, sustainable intensification, ecological  intensification, eco-efficient agriculture or agro-ecological intensification.   16  resilience,  better  animal  welfare,  and  environmental  service  provision  (e.g.,  clean  water,  flood  protection, recreational and cultural landscape values).   Not  all  of  these  outcomes  can  be  achieved  at  once  or  simultaneously  everywhere.  Trade-offs  among  different outcomes are often required to achieve SAI76. High priority must be given to helping farmers  worldwide  adapt  to  climate  change  and  weather  extremes  by  building  more  resilient  agricultural  systems. Otherwise, world food security will be at tremendous risk and other development goals cannot  be achieved28. Agricultural labor productivity is of fundamental importance to economic growth, poverty  reduction and food security and must receive sufficient attention when setting the goals and strategies  for future, sustainable agriculture15. Simply speaking, SAI aims to reduce the environmental footprint of  agriculture  while  meeting  all  of  its  other  goals.  That  requires  making  farming  more  precise  by  implementing  genetic,  agro-ecological,  as  well  as  socioeconomic  intensification  measures,  and  having  the necessary support systems in place for maximum impact (Fig. 2-1)86.

Sustainable Agricultural Intensification and its enabling environment.   Source: Modified from The Montpellier Panel86.  In practice, workable options - actionable \"solutions\" - must focus on raising the diversity, productivity,  efficiency, resilience, value and therefore also the overall profitability of farming. This is the entry point  for moving from the vicious circles trapping rural people in poverty or creating environmental problems  towards virtuous circles of agriculture for sustainable development (Fig. 2-2).  It requires flexibility to  adapt to new information and the recognition that the information upon which one takes initial action  may, in retrospect, be misinformation. Sustainability will necessarily require trial and error, i.e., adaptive  approaches on a grand scale. One of the chief hurdles will be to deal with resistance to change.  Raising productivity has additional benefits to those listed above; it is also an entry point for creating  jobs  and  entering  new  domestic  and  export  markets.  If  done  properly,  productivity-  enhancing  technologies reduce the unit cost of food production as well as the ecological footprint per unit food  17  produced. They lead to a supply shift and thus reduced equilibrium market prices for commodities. The  reduced  lower  prices  positively  affect  food  and  nutritional  security  and  reduce  poverty.  But  lowered  prices  also  reduce  the  profitability  of  expanding  cultivation  into  marginal  areas,  thus  reducing  the  demand  and  the  incentives  for  agricultural  incursion  into  remaining  natural  ecosystems.  This  in  turn  results in positive consequences, such as better conservation of biodiversity or less emissions of carbon  stored  in  aboveground  vegetative  biomass  or  soils  of  natural  ecosystems.  The  virtuous  circle  can  be  greatly  accelerated  through  efficient  support  systems:  e.g.,  policies,  infrastructure,  markets,  research  and development, human resources, digital information, and other tools.

Among the greatest challenges for agriculture is to boost crop yield growth rates to levels that would  allow  feeding  the  growing  world  population  a  healthy  diet  primarily  through  increased  production  growth  on  existing  agricultural  land.  In  most  low-  and  middle-income  countries  diversification  of  cropping systems and/or conserving more land can only happen if yield growth in cereals and other food  staples  can  be  accelerated.  How  fast  yields  need  to grow depends  on  the  overall  trajectories  of  food  demand in a country, how much more land could safely be utilized for agriculture, or to what extent  cropping  intensity  on  existing  land  can  be  increased.  Food  production  projections  by  FAO  assume  an  annual global crop yield growth rate of only 0.8% during 2005/2007 to 2050, whereas arable land area  would expand by more than 70 million hectares during that period18. However, if arable land expansion  is to be halted completely, global yield growth rates have to be accelerated substantially. One target of  sustainable  agriculture  should  be  to  ensure  that  annual  yield  growth  of  the  worlds  most  important  staple crops rises as fast as or faster than the demand by closing existing productivity gaps and raising  the yield ceiling. Ensuring food security in the 2015-2030 period with minimum expansion of agriculture  would  require  that  yields  of  the  major  cereal  crops  increase  by  about  1.3-1.5%  each  year.  Growth  in  major food staples cannot be compromised, but countries should also take other measures, including  feeding less grain to cattle or using them as biofuels, and enhancing the productivity and adoption of  legumes and other crops of local importance.    18  To define the right SAI strategy in a country, a precise understanding of yield, efficiency and/or product  quality  and  value  gaps,  i.e.,  how  large  they  are,  where  they  occur,  and  what  their  biophysical  and  socioeconomic causes are, is needed at sub-national and local levels.n Progress has recently been made  in  establishing  better  methodologies  for  yield  gap  analysis,  mapping  the  yield  gaps  of  major  crops  at  global and regional scales, and understanding their different contexts92-96. Although this is encouraging,  a lot more remains to be done to obtain a deep understanding of yield and efficiency gaps in the worlds  major agricultural systems, at a scale that enables people to use this knowledge for concrete action in  farmers fields. Similar methodologies need to be applied to quantify livestock productivity gaps.   Figure 2-3. Yield-defining, yield-limiting and yield-reducing factors determine the exploitable yield  gaps in crop production.  Source: Modified from Tittonell and Giller96.   Some yield gaps in food-deficient regions of the world can still be exploited through relatively simple  interventions such as better seed, appropriate and efficient use of fertilizers, and better crop, soil and  water  management92.  Likewise,  low  livestock  productivity  can  be  tackled  through  better  feeding  practices  (quantity  and  quality  of  feed),  improved  animal  health  (preventative  measures  such  as  vaccines), better animal handling and transport, and robust breeding strategies. However, for most of  the  world  it  is  generally  necessary  to  move  towards  more  precise,  knowledge-intensive  forms  of                                                               n Many different definitions of yield gap are in use and methods for quantifying them vary widely24,91. We use a biophysical  definition of crop yield gaps following a production ecology concept that focuses on yields per unit land area (productive  capacity and impact on the environment), recognizing that productivity per person is just as critical (in defining real food  prices, real incomes across an economy, economic diversification, etc.).  19  agriculture  and provide the technologies and incentives that make it viable for farmers to adapt and  adopt them. In crop production a key goal is to apply modern production ecology principles to improving  the  management  of  each  and  every  field,  no  matter  how  small  or  how  large  it  is97.  Farmers  and  agricultural  professionals  must  learn  how  varietal  characteristics,  the  environment,  and  agronomic  management determine what yield (and income) can be achieved at a given location (Fig. 2-3)95,96,98. The  interplay of these factors determines both the productivity and overall efficiency of the system as well  as its environmental impact.   Yield potential is defined as the maximum yield of a crop variety when grown in environments to which  it is well adapted, with nutrients and water non-limiting, and pests and diseases effectively controlled. It  is  primarily  defined  by  varietal  characteristics  and  climate,  mainly  solar  radiation  and  temperature  regime98. For crops grown under rainfed conditions the amount of water available during the growing  season  determines  the  yield  ceiling,  i.e.,  the  water-limited  yield  potential.  Yield  potential  is  highly  variable  across  and  within  regions.  It  is  impossible  for  a  large  population  of  farmers  to  have  the  perfection in crop and soil management required to achieve the full yield potential, and it would also  not  be  cost-effective  to  aim  for  this  because  yield  response  to  inputs  follows  diminishing  returns  as  average farm yields approach the yield potential. Average farm yields often begin to plateau when they  reach about 75 to 85% of the yield ceiling9,24. Hence, a realistic goal of SAI should be to move as many  farmers as possible from current average yields to about 80% of the yield potential (or water-limited  yield  potential),  which  has  been  shown  to  be  a  general,  profitable  target  for  the  yield  that  can  be  attained with good management95. This requires choosing the right variety and systematically improving  soil, water, and crop, pest and disease management to adapt to the environment and close the yield  gaps caused by yield-limiting as well as yield-reducing factors (Fig. 2-3).   Varieties with high yield potential, enhanced tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and high nutrition  and  product  value  are  a  prerequisite  for  successful  agriculture.  The  addition  of  high  nutritional  value  would  contribute  significantly  to  food  and  nutritional  security.  Recent  advances  in  gene  discovery,  biotechnology and genomics-based precision breeding methods have opened up new opportunities for  genetic  improvement  that  must  be  fully  exploited99,100,108,109,  particularly  those  that  can  benefit  smallholder  farmers  most.  The  full  potential  of  modern  biotechnologyo for  genetic  improvement  of  plants  and  animals  has  to  be  harnessed  faster  because  it  is  one  of  the  key  technologies  that  will  be  required  for  meeting  multiple  goals  of  SAI,  including  increasing  productivity  and  protecting  the  environment (Box 2-1). Developing countries need a rationale debate about GM crops that thoroughly  weighs the benefits and risks and leads to each country making informed decisions that are not swayed  by politicized arguments dominant in Europe110. We must also recognize, however, that improvement of  complex traits such as yield potential or drought tolerance remains much more challenging and slow,  requiring long-term investment and a multitude of approaches26,111-113.  Implementing SAI in crop production implies taking full advantage of genetic potential by implementing  good agronomic principles tailored to the local context, including:   Profitable and sustainable crop rotations and other forms of using functional diversity in time  and space, including intercropping where appropriate   Tillage, cover crop and crop residue management that conserves and improves soil productivity                                                               o Biotechnology  in  agriculture  includes  a  range  of  technologies  used  in  crop  and  animal  breeding  programs.  It  includes  conventional methods (e.g., molecular-marker assisted selection, tissue culture) as well as genetic engineering. The latter is  often referred to as \"genetic modification\" (GM), \"GMO\", \"GM food\", or \"transgenics\". Genetic engineering involves a precise,  mediated transfer of one or few genes (DNA sequences) from other organisms, but it may also involve mutation or deletion of  genes.    20   Access to quality seed of well-adapted varieties that meet local preferences or market demands   Planting at the right time to maximize the attainable yield   Maximizing the capture and efficient utilization of available water for high water productivity   Precise, integrated use of mineral fertilizers and available organic nutrient sources to meet crop   nutrient requirements with high efficiency and sustained soil quality  Integrated  pest  management  strategies  that  biodiversity, biological control and the judicious use of pesticides   include  host-plant  resistance,  functional   Harvesting at the right time   Optimizing  recycling  and  use  of  biomass  and  agricultural  by-products,  including  better  use  of  crop residues for livestock feeding or other purposes   With the right approach and support mechanisms, agronomic interventions can lead to fast, large and  sustainable productivity and efficiency gains (Box 2-2).  Box 2-1. Biotechnology as a component of SAI  Biotechnologies  such  as  tissue  culture,  genomics,  marker-assisted  selection  and  genetic  engineering  can  contribute  to  successful  implementation  of  SAI  strategies  in  many  agricultural  systems  worldwide,  to  the  benefit  of  both  farmers  and  consumers.   The  application  of  DNA-based  technologies  can  improve  the  effectiveness of conventional crop and animal improvement programs, allowing natural genetic diversity to be  better understood and utilized99,100. Transgenic or GM approaches may be useful when the variation available  in  the  natural  gene  pool  is  not  sufficient  to  overcome  major  constraints  to  crop  and  animal  productivity,  improve  tolerance  to  stresses  and  increase  nutrition  quality.  The  available  scientific  evidence  is  clear:  biotechnology  solutions  are  not  necessarily  more  risky  than  conventional  plant  and  animal  breeding  technologies, and they can be deployed safely under regulations that detect and prevent hazards to human  health and the environment. As a result, commercially released GM crops have sharply reduced farmers use of  herbicides, pesticides and fossil fuels, while consumers use of ingredients derived from GM crops has been no  riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant  improvement techniques101-103. In their more than 15 years of existence, GM crops have contributed positively  to commercial and smallholder agriculture in all regions where they have been introduced, in terms of farmers  profits, health, and agronomic and environmental impacts104-106. As with any other new technologies, farmers  as well as consumers should have the right to chose from a range of available options, for which the scientific  community must provide evidence-based, unbiased information. Genetic engineering solutions in agriculture  need to be monitored and managed well, as integral components of SAI strategies and with measures in place  that  allow  the  detection  and  prevention  of  any  risks  that  may  occur,  including  legal  or  financial  risks  for  farmers. Most of the GM solutions that have been commercialized so far have focused on single or few traits,  e.g., insect resistance (Bt) or herbicide resistance in crops such as cotton, maize, soybean and canola. For GM  technologies to play a more significant role in ensuring food and nutrition security as well as protecting the  environment,  more  complex  genetic  engineering  challenges  will  have  to  be  tackled,  including  drought  tolerance, nitrogen use efficiency and yield potential. Intellectual property needs to be protected, but it must  also be made widely available for wider utilization in breeding programs of public institutions as well as small  seed companies. Breeding and biotechnology capacity in national programs has to be expanded greatly in most  developing countries. Rethinking of institutional arrangements, biosafety laws and variety release systems is  required,  towards  lower  costs  and  faster  approval  of  GM  crops/animals  and  greater  participation  by  small  companies and the public sector - but without comprising safety or environmental risks107.  lesson  from  successful   One  major  is  that  simplistic,  universal  prescriptions  or  recommendations will not work. The principles of SAI can be applied to any production system and its  associated value chain, no matter whether it is conventional, organic or some other form of agriculture.  It  can  be  done  in  farm  enterprises  of  different  sizes  and  degrees  of  market  integration  and  will  particularly benefit resource-limited, small farm enterprises. Actual crop yield, water productivity and  profitability are to a large extent determined by weather and the quality of soil, water, nutrient and crop  interventions  21  management    the  interactions  between  genotype,  environment  and  management.  Knowledgeable  farmers  with  access  to  good  quality  land,  inputs  and  new  technologies  will  be  more  successful  in  exploiting the location-specific yield potential than farmers who do not have these assets.    Box 2-2. Success through better agronomy extension in irrigated rice systems of South America  In  recent  years  irrigated  lowland  rice  yields  have  risen  rapidly  in  some  countries  of  South  America  and  elsewhere  at  an  annual  growth  rate  four  to  five  times  the  global  average.  For  example,  on  about  1  million  hectares in southern Brazil average irrigated rice yields stagnated around 5-5.5 t/ha from 1982 to 2002, but  increased to 7-7.5 t/ha in recent years. A similar phenomenon has occurred in Uruguay, where rice yields rose  by 25%, from about 6.5 t/ha in 2000 to over 8 t/ha at present. The major factors contributing to this success  were:     Strong public research and extension systems, including qualified, motivated extension agronomists   Science-based,  production-scale  agronomic  management  principles  that can be  tailored to  farm-specific  needs  A  participatory  research  and  extension  approach,  including  key  stakeholders  and  farmer-to-farmer  extension  Functioning markets, supply chains and local agri-businesses with transparent business relationships  Good governance and supporting policies that avoided distortions or disincentives    Extension  programs  also  reward  farmers  for  meeting  best  management  standards  and  environmental  stewardship requirements, which are also communicated to rice consumers through branding schemes. Water  consumption,  nitrogen  consumption,  energy  consumption  and  methane  emissions  per  unit  food  produced  have all decreased. Agrochemical use was reduced and soil and water quality meet high standards.     Another  lesson  is  that  SAI  should  not  aim  to  blindly  copy  natural  ecosystems  that  have  not  been  optimized for food, feed, fiber or bioenergy production114. Instead, SAI can derive options from natural  systems,  traditional  systems,  industrial  systems  and  alternative  systems;  from  experimentation  and  traditional  knowledge;  from  scientific  theory  and  empirical  observation.  These  options  need  to  be  tailored  to  local  conditions  by  well-integrated  research  and  development  systems.  Although  many  principles  for  a  systematic  SAI  approach  are  generic,  the  scope  for  increasing  eco-efficiency  in  agriculture can vary widely (Box 2-3).   Similar  SAI  concepts  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of  agricultural  systems.  Livestock  systems  play  a  particularly  significant  role  for  food  and  nutrition  security,  rural  livelihoods  and  the  economies  of  developing  countries.  They  provide  nourishment  for  rural  and  urban  households,  income  and  employment for producers and others working in value chains, and a crucial asset and safety net for the  poor45,51. Increasing the productivity, resource efficiency and sustainability of livestock systems includes  following principles such as45,46,116:   Adopting management practices that improve animal health and welfare   Increasing animal productivity and efficiency through genetic improvements and better feeding,  including adoption of age-specific, balanced feed rations   Decreasing  pollution  by  optimizing  critical  metabolic  and  nutrient  cycles  (e.g.,  nitrogen,  phosphorus, methane gas emissions)  Improving rangeland productivity, diversity and grazing management   Enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience    Adapting management practices that preserve biological diversity in livestock agroecosystems   Using  manure  within  comprehensive  nutrient  management  systems  while  recognizing  and  mitigating its associated health and contamination risks   22  Box 2-3. Pathways for improving eco-efciency will differ among diverse cropping systems  Global  food  security  requires  producing  the  required  food  and  ber  crops  concomitant  with  ecologically  efficient use of resources. This eco-efficiency concept was used to diagnose the state of agricultural production  in China (irrigated wheatmaize double-cropping systems), Zimbabwe (rainfed maize systems), and Australia  (rainfed  wheat  systems)115.  More  than  3,000  surveyed  crop  yields  were  compared  against  simulated  grain  yields at actual levels of nitrogen (N) input.  Many Australian commercial wheat farmers are close to existing  production frontiers and gain little additional return from increasing their N input. Signicant losses of N from  their systems are infrequent and at low intensities relative to their level of grain production. These Australian  farmers operate close to eco-efcient frontiers with regard to N. Innovations in technologies and practices are  essential  to  increasing  their  production  without  added  economic  or  environmental  risks.  In  contrast,  many  Chinese farmers can reduce N input without sacricing production through more efcient use of their fertilizer  input.  There  are  real  prospects  for  the  double-cropping  systems  on  the  North  China  Plain  to  achieve  both  production  increases  and  reduced  environmental  risks.  Zimbabwean  farmers,  on  the  other  hand,  have  the  opportunity  for  signicant  production  increases  by  both  improving  their  technical  efciency  and  increasing  nitrogen  and  other  inputs.  Doing  so  will  require  improved  management  expertise  and  greater  access  to  institutional support for addressing the higher risks that can be associated.   Aquaculture  -  the  farmed  production  of  fish,  shellfish,  and  aquatic  plants  such  as  algae  -  is  currently  among the fastest growing animal food production sectors in many developed and developing countries.  It will soon supply more than half of the world's seafood for human consumption49,117. Continued growth  in aquaculture production is likely to come from further intensification, which is often accompanied by a  range of resource  and  environmental  problems. Novel culture systems, alternative feeding strategies,  and species choices are among the SAI strategies for such systems, but policies that provide incentives  for innovation and environmental improvement are equally important117.  Further important components are urban food production and delivery systems, which have two facets:   (i) bringing food from peri-urban and rural areas to meet the needs of urban centers and their inherent  systems, policies and regulations; (ii) opportunities for producing food in the urban environment. The  potential for urban food production needs to be assessed realistically, but there may also be important  avenues for improving it within a SAI context (Box 2-4).   In summary, a flexible approach for SAI must embrace modern science and technology and combine it  with  local  knowledge,  enabling  governance  and  business  support  systems  to  develop  and  implement  location-specific  solutions.  In  the  short  term  there  is  an  opportunity  to  address  local  and  regional  markets through incremental improvements. With improved performance and the expansion of regional  infrastructure and governance, global markets may be accessed, depending on the commodity grown  and  its  competitiveness.  Importantly,  SAI  requires  better  access  to  and  utilization  of  knowledge  and  information by all actors along the value chain.  2.3. Climate-smart agricultural landscapes  Implementing  SAI  in  practice  is  also  situated  within  broader  concepts  of  a  more  Climate-Smart  Agriculture (CSA), uniting the agendas of the agriculture, development and climate change communities.  Historically, farmers have adapted their farming systems and management practices to changing climate  and  variable  weather.  This  process  needs  to  accelerate  in  our  generation.  In  that  context,  CSA  is  a  continuous process of improving agriculture through innovations in policies, technologies, management,  and financing that aim to:    Sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes;  Strengthen  the  adaptive  capacity  and  resilience  of  people,  food  production  systems  and  ecosystems in agricultural landscapes;  23   Reduce and/or remove greenhouse gases emissions, where possible119,120.  The concept and practical solutions for CSA are still debated because the relationship between these  three dimensions is poorly understood121. It often involves trade-offs, driven by different incentives by  different  actors.  Why,  for  example,  should  a  poor  farmers  invest  in  agricultural  practices  that  may  reduce GHG emissions if there are few if any immediate benefits related to his income or food security?  In practice, many improved agricultural practices can be considered climate-smart, but not all may have  the  desirable  short-  and  long-term  benefits.  Just  from  a  plant  breeding  perspective,  there  are  often  trade-offs between yield gain and yield stability, if not resilience. Is mitigation, e.g., in livestock systems,  compatible  with  intensification?  Hard  choices  may  often  have  to  be  made  on  trade-offs  between  intensification,  mitigation  and  adaptation.  Climate-smart  agriculture  should  therefore  be  developed  further, as an implementation concept that also utilizes the SAI principles stated above to bring us closer  to  operating  within  foreseeable  local  and  planetary  limits  for  agricultural  and  food  systems121.  Scientifically sound indicators and metrics must be defined to guide this process.  Box 2-4. What is the potential for urban food production?   There  are complex and often well-integrated systems  and  processes  (often private sector  driven) that bring  food to urban areas and ensure it can be reached by the urban populations through a range of traders, retail  markets, shops and supermarkets, or direct purchasing from producers or middlemen by consumers through  electronic and other means for door-to-door delivery. The need for packaging and transportation increases the  carbon footprint of agricultural products and there are potential losses from poor postharvest management of  perishable products. Where in place, inflexible regulatory systems between retailers and consumers minimize  risk to the consumer while creating a large amount of wastage. There has always been urban food production  in cities e.g. market gardens for perishable, high-value products and also for recreational or home production  in gardens or through city-allocated land allotments. Where property rights are not well established, including  many cities in Africa and Asia, there has been an opportunistic incursion onto available land for production of  crop and animal products, and along rivers and streams. Most urban food production focuses on high-value  and  perishable  products  such  as  vegetables  and  milk.  There  are  also  opportunities  for  vertical  production,  rooftop gardens and small-scale crop production in cities to fill some commercial and household niches. What  proportion of the food for cities  can be safely grown within city boundaries remains unknown and it is also  uncertain  how  much  of  this  is  actually  marketed.  Land  is  expected  to  be  in  even  shorter  supply  as  urban  infrastructure  deepens.  Urban  crop  and  animal  producers  and  consumers  also  need  to  be  aware  of  the  possibility  of  contamination  with  heavy  metals,  pathogenic  microorganisms,  pesticides,  manure  and  other  byproducts  where  waters  contaminated  with  industrial  effluent  and/or  sewage  are  used  for  irrigation.  New  strategies and technologies for increasing vertical food production in cities are being studied118. However,  the  costs  of  this  are  likely  to  be  uncompetitive  with  traditional  supplies  from  rural  and  peri-urban  sources.  Current  rates  of  urbanization  suggest,  even  in  less  developed  areas,  that  the  rural  population  will  start  to  decline  absolutely  over  the  period  to  2030.  There  is  likely  to  be  land  consolidation  and  growing  labor  productivity in rural-based agriculture resulting in increased productivity and lowering costs; it is unlikely that  capital-intensive urban production will have a comparative advantage over increased labor and land efficiency  in rural areas, but it will continue to play a local but important role in the food system.   incorporating  adaptation  and  mitigation  Beyond achieving such climate-smart objectives, agricultural systems must also provide and protect a  wide  range  of  ecosystem  services.  Many  need  to  be  operated  on  principles  of  integrated  landscape  management,  while  explicitly  into  their  management  objectives122.  Such  landscape  approaches  seek  to  provide  principles  and  tools  for  allocating  and  managing  land  to  achieve  social,  economic,  and  environmental  objectives  in  areas  where  agriculture,  mining,  and  other  land  uses  compete  with  environmental  and  biodiversity  goals123.  Potential exists  in  many  agricultural  areas  to  realize  greater  efficiencies  and  multiple  benefits  through  managing  larger  landscapes  and  regions.  Examples  include  large-scale  irrigation  and  rainwater  harvesting  systems;  grazing reserves in a small portion of the landscape that can be accessed by livestock keepers in times of   24  drought; ecological engineering approaches for integrated pest and disease management; management  of invasive alien crop or animal species (e.g., exotic weeds, crop an animal diseases, fish); or payment  for environmental services schemes. Promising examples have already emerged in all world regions.  There  are  many  uncertainties,  competing  demands  and  other  factors  that  often  require  making  compromises  in  land  use  and  landscape  management.  Achieving  multiple  objectives  is  an  ongoing  process  subject  to  negotiation,  learning,  adaptation,  and  improvement.  Ten  principles  have  recently  been proposed to guide the process of decision-making in landscape contexts:   1. Continual learning and adaptive management,   2. Common concern entry point,   3. Multiple scales,   4. Multifunctionality,   5. Multiple stakeholders,   6. Negotiated and transparent change logic,   7. Clarification of rights and responsibilities,  8. Participatory and user-friendly monitoring,   9. Resilience and   10. Strengthened stakeholder capacity123.     25  3. Agriculture in the post-2015 action agenda for sustainable development 3.1. General considerations  Directly and indirectly agriculture will contribute to achieving interrelated development outcomes such  as  poverty,  food  and  nutritional  security,  economic  and  social  development,  gender  equality,  energy,  water, climate, biodiversity, peace and security, and disaster prevention or mitigation. A framework is  needed  for  understanding  and  realizing  these  contributions,  with  clear  goals  and  targets,  effective  solutions  for  concrete  action,  and  indicators  that  allow  measuring  progress.  Building  on  the  Rio+20  outcome, sustainable development is a holistic concept with four interconnected dimensions: economic  development  (including  ending  poverty),  social  inclusion,  environmental  sustainability,  and  good  governance124. Measures taken to improve one dimension often improve others125.   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the post-2015 era and the concrete Targets for these goals  still  need  to  be  agreed  on  by  the  global  community.  They  will  guide  the  publics  understanding  of  complex  sustainable  development  challenges,  inspire  action,  promote  integrated  thinking,  and  foster  accountability.  They  will  be  complementary  to  the  tools  of  international  law  by  providing  a  shared  normative  framework  that  fosters  collaboration  across  countries125.  Each  country  needs  to  choose  its  own sustainable development paths, with specific, achievable targets at country or local level and taking  into account their current positions along these paths. We use the following definitions125,126:  Goal  Expresses  an  ambitious,  specific  commitment.  Lays  out  a  single  challenge  with  great  impact. Should be universal, comprehensive, operational, and easy to understand.  Specific, measurable, attainable, time-bound sub-component that contributes in a major  way  to  achievement  of  the  goal,  i.e.,  an  outcome  variable  that  is  easy  to  understand,  representing one major direction of change. To qualify as a target, the problem must be  preventable  or  a  way  out  of  it  is  found  through  interventions  in  agriculture  and  food  systems. Targets should be specified at the global and national level, reflecting the level of  ambition of each country and the speed at which a country pursues a goal.   A sound, measurable metric to assess whether the target is being met, including detecting  trends  and  anomalies.  Often  multiple  indicators  are  used  for  this  purpose.  Indicators  should be meaningful, sensitive to the most critical aspects of a target, reliable and doable  in  terms  of  available  data  and  measurement  protocols,  quickly  available,  and  easy  to  understand by policy makers, investors and other stakeholders. They should also allow for  disaggregation, i.e., targets to be measured in various dimensions, such as by geography,  socioeconomic status, gender, age, and ethnicity, for example.   Target  Indicator  Goals and targets for agriculture and food systems need to encourage systematic solutions for making  food production, processing, trade and distribution more sustainable, equitable and resilient, thus also  contributing  to  nutrition  and  other  outcomes127.  They  also  need  to  address  the  trade-offs  between  consumption in wealthier countries and its potential consequences for other countries. Where trade- offs  are  required  in  cases  of  scarce  resources,  the  needs  of  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  people  must be addressed first, many of whom live in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture. The new SDGs  and targets also need to mobilize attention and action to reverse or mitigate threats to food production  from  ecosystem  degradation  affecting  landscapes  and  whole  communities,  many  of  which  cannot  be  overcome  with  improved  seeds  or  farm-level  nutrient  and  water  management  solutions.  These  offer   26  great opportunities for collaborative action between agriculture, rural development, environment and  education ministries and other stakeholders in the SDGs.  Most targets should be defined as practically achievable targets for which decision-makers can be held  accountable. Recognizing the aspirations of the Zero Hunger Challengep we aim to provide guidance on  pragmatic targets, indicators and approaches that could ultimately lead towards meeting that challenge.  We  recognize  that  solving  global  problems  involves  many  transnational  issues,  but  we  propose  that  goals and targets should place strong emphasis on the responsibilities of countries, including developed  and developing countries.   First contours of possible post-2015 SDGs and their specific targets are emerging. The UN System Task  Team  on  the  Post-2015  UN  Development  Agenda  provided first suggestions, including a discussion of  statistics and indicators for the post-2015 development agenda128,129.  In its report to the UN Secretary  General the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda proposed 12  possible SDGs with 54 targets126. Agriculture makes direct and indirect contributions to 9 of the 12 goals  proposed, but particularly to Goal 1 (End Poverty), Goal 5 (Ensure Food Security and Good Nutrition) and  Goal 9 (Manage Natural Resource Assets Sustainably). The Sustainable Development Solutions Network  (SDSN)  proposed  10  priority  development  challenges  addressing  the  four  dimensions  of  sustainable  development. They are interconnected and form the basis for 10 possible SDGs with 30 targets designed  to trigger practical solutions that countries can pursue with high priority (Annex 2)125.   We restrict our discussion to the SDGs and targets proposed by the SDSN, primarily to stimulate further  discussion. Because poverty and hunger must be eradicated in our generation a prominent stand-alone  goal should address that urgent need (Goal 1). The global development agenda should also have a goal  that explicitly focuses on improving agricultural systems and rural development in an integrated manner  (Goal  6),  to  adequately  address  the  need  for  transformative  changes  that  are  required  to  make  agriculture more productive and more sustainable, as underscored by the interim report of the Open  Working  Group  on  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Food  and  nutrition  security  targets  are  fully  embedded in these two goals, recognizing that adequate and nutritious food is a universal human right  and all the states in the world have the responsibility to respect, secure and implement this right. Future  goals should pay extra attention to the availability and quality of food during the first 1000 days (from  conception  until  the  age  of  two),  because  malnutrition  under  the  age  of  two  is  fatal  for  a  persons  development in the longer term. We must also recognize and capture the contributions of agriculture to  goals on gender equality and social inclusion, health, climate change and energy, ecosystem services and  natural resources, and good governance.   The new SDG framework could more explicitly address sustainable landscape management as a goal or  targets  and  indicators  that  focus  on  livelihood  provision,  ecosystem  services,  products,  and  resource  efficiency as key landscape dimensions130. Difficulties in terms of political and administrative planning,  implementation  and  monitoring  may  be  associated  with  a  landscape-based  framework,  but  we  encourage further discussion of this. Likewise, a holistic global framework such as FAOs Sustainability  Assessment of Food And Agriculture (SAFA) could be applied for the assessment of sustainability along  food  and  agriculture  value  chains,  to  establish  an  international  reference  for  assessing  trade-offs  and  synergies between all dimensions of sustainability131. Elements of it could also be applied to the SDGs  and their targets and indicators.                                                               p Aspirational goals stated for the Zero Hunger Challenge are: (1) 100% access to adequate food for all, throughout the year; (2)  Zero  stunted  children  less  than  2  years  of  age;  (3)  All  food  systems  are  sustainable;  (4)  100%  increase  in  smallholder  productivity and income and (5) Zero loss or waste of food. www.un.org/en/zerohunger   27  Unless  otherwise  noted,  the  targets  stated  are  for  2030  (relative  to  the  current  situation,  i.e.,  2010- 2015). Most targets need to be specified at country or sub-national level. We propose indicators that  link to existing ones, such as the current MDGs (www.un.org/millenniumgoals) and those used by many  United Nations agencies and other international and national organizations, including the World Bank  (http://data.worldbank.org),  but  we  also  propose  some  new  ones  that  may  be  needed  for  assessing  progress  in  agriculture  and  its  associated  functions.  Some  indicators  may  also  be  improved  towards  measuring more deeply the inequality within a country, and many should be disaggregated by gender.  Both  existing  and  new  indicators  will  require  improved  data  collection  and  other  monitoring  mechanisms.  Statistical  agencies  should  promote  the  use  of  advanced  data  tools,  including  remote  sensing, real-time monitoring with smartphones, crowd sourcing, GIS mapping and other techniques.  Due  to  the  diversity  and  complexity  of  agriculture  and  food  systems,  setting  concrete  targets  for  the  next 15-20 years is challenging. The concept of planetary boundariesq is used by the SDSN for guiding  the  transformative  changes  needed  for  sustainable  development  on  a  global  scale125,132,133.  Achieving  future  growth  within  these  boundaries  will  require  the  adoption  of  sustainable  technologies  and  behaviors  that  decouple  economic  growth  from  unsustainable  patterns  of  production  and  consumption125,133. There is an ongoing debate on the relevance of planetary boundaries for agriculture  and  how  they  could  be  quantified.  For  example,  the  currently  proposed  planetary  boundaries  for  nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows have been arbitrarily set, do not include social dimensions, and  would  likely  lead  to  severe  risks  for  ensuring  global  food  security41.  Moreover,  adoption  of  new  technologies in agriculture is a slow and uneven process, which also affects what realistic growth rates  for  improving  productivity  and  resource  use  efficiencies  could  be.  Recognizing  that  major  transformations  in  food  systems  will  take  time  and  also  involve  many  trade-offs,  the  targets  and  aspirational outcomes we propose for the post-2015 period should be viewed as a starting point. For  example,  the  main  rationale  for  proposing  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  resources  such  as  water,  nutrients  and  energy  in  agriculture  and  food  systems  by  30%  in  2030  relative  to  current  levels  (see  Target 6a) is that, on a global scale, improvements in the efficiency of these resources should at least  exceed  the  annual  rates  of  yield  increase  required  during  that  period.  Just  achieving  this  would  be  a  major, welcome departure from the trajectories of the past five decades. Transformative changes that  could lead to even greater efficiency gains will likely take more time, including radical shifts in diets or  major reductions of food loss or waste.   We suggest outcome-oriented measures of success for most indicators, i.e., numerical values (in square  brackets)  that  countries  could  aspire  to  achieve,  for  setting  their  own  vision  of  success.  They  can  be  viewed as minimum thresholds to aim for, but require further analysis and consensus. Such quantitative  targets will differ among countries, depending on their starting points and the different transformational  pathways  to  enter.  Hence,  timelines  and  additional  indicators  could  be  adapted  to  national  circumstances,  and  countries  may  also  use  additional  targets  and  indicators.  Customization  and  disaggregation of targets and indicators form the basis for tailoring practical solutions for meeting the  aggregated  global  SDGs  (Chapter  4).  Implementation  pathways  require  country-specific  analyses  and  involvement  by  many  stakeholders  to  exploit  all  opportunities,  and  to  improve  metrics  and  data  gathering  processes  and  other  tools  that  enhance  decision  making,  education,  communication  and  behavioral change (Chapter 5). Building more reliable data systems that provide timely, disaggregated  indicators  to  measure  progress  in  all  countries,  sub-populations,  and  at  all  levels  (local,  sub-national,                                                               q Planetary boundaries define the safe operating space for humanity in the Earth system. climate change, biodiversity loss,  biochemical cycles (nitrogen and phosphorus loading), global freshwater use, land use change, ocean acidification,  stratospheric ozone, chemical pollution, and atmospheric aerosol loading132.    28  national, regional, global) will be vital for success. It requires the use of innovative technologies as well  as greater, sustained investments in monitoring world agriculture and food systems (see Chapter 3.2).  The  subsequent  discussion  focuses  on  contributions  of  sustainable  agriculture  and  food  systems  to  Goals 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 (Annex 2). Agriculture also contributes to other Goals, such as Goals 3 and 4.   3.2. Sustainable Development Goals, Targets and Indicators for agriculture and food systems  GOAL 1: END EXTREME POVERTY INCLUDING HUNGER  End extreme poverty in all its forms (MDGs 1-7), including hunger, child stunting, malnutrition, and food  insecurity. Support highly vulnerable countries.   Target 1a. End absolute income poverty ($1.25 or less per day) and hunger, including achieving food security  and appropriate nutrition, and ending child stunting.  Comments  Current MDG 1 indicator 1.1, but using the current  World Bank threshold for poverty, i.e., the percentage  of population living on less than $1.25 a day (PPP at  2005 prices). The threshold to use may require further  adjustment. Global poverty rates cannot be directly  compared with national level poverty rates, which are  derived using country specific poverty lines estimated  in local currencies. Multiple poverty lines can be  used for further disaggregation and analysis.   iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet  Similar to the current MDG 1 indicator 1.3; countries  often have their own thresholds for what constitutes  acceptable poverty for their citizens, defined at a  national or sub-national level. This indicator would  allow countries to move the poverty line upwards  over time126. This indicator could also be defined as  income or consumption share held by the lowest [x]%.  Current MDG 1 indicator 1.9; but could be measured  in various ways. Calorie availability can be measured  at the country level based on national food balance  sheets (FAO), or at household level from food  expenditure or consumption surveys. FAO uses  country-specific cut-offs for minimum energy  requirements calculated by the WHO for different age  and gender groups6. This indicator could also be  defined as the share of people consuming less than  2100 calories per day (depending on the region) to  measure the proportion and total number of the most  food-insecure people7.   A simple dietary diversity indicator that is well  correlated with stunting, wasting and low Body Mass  Index. Can be calculated from FAO food balance  sheets, with staple foods consisting of cereals and  root crops, but preferably from more disaggregated  data sources that also allow assessing distribution  differences within a country or within households134.  Aspirational outcomes  The number of people living on  less than [$1.25] a day is  effectively zero by 2030 in every  country.  The share of people living below  their countrys 2015 national  poverty threshold is less than  [x]%  The share of the population not  able to meet minimum calorie  requirements is effectively zero  by 2030 in every country.  The share of calories from non- staple foods has increased by  [20]% by 2030 (relative to a  2010 baseline). The share of  animal-derived protein in the  diet of women and young  children has increased by [20]%  Possible Indicators  Proportion of  population with  income below  [$1.25] a day (PPP)  (%)  Proportion of  population living  below a countrys  poverty line (%)  Proportion of  population below  minimum level of  dietary energy  consumption (%)  Share of calories  from non-staple  foods (%)  29  Prevalence of  stunting in children  under [5] years of  age (%)  Prevalence of  anemia in non- pregnant women of  reproductive age (%)  Other indicators could be used too, for example an  indicator reflecting the share of animal protein in the  diets of pregnant women and young children, which is  likely to be related to anemia, stunting and other  consequences of malnutrition.   Defined as percentage of children under five years of  age whose height-for-age is below minus two  standard deviations from the median of the WHO  Child Growth Standards. Child growth data are widely  available;  WHO has maintained the Global Database  on Child Growth and Malnutrition since 1986135. Good  trend data already exist, but more global training will  be needed on how to properly measure height at  young age. Some experts suggest to use a stunting  indicator defined as up to age 2 as a measure more  sensitive to conditions for the most recently born.  Proportion of non-pregnant women in reproductive  age (15-49 yrs.) with hemoglobin concentration of  <120 g/L at sea level. Anemia is diagnosed through  finger-prick blood sample tests. The test could be  easily integrated in regular health or prenatal visit to  capture all women of reproductive age. Data on  anemia prevalence collected in 1993-2005 are  available for 73% of non-pregnant women of  reproductive age, in 82 countries135.  in countries with high  prevalence of malnutrition and  low-meat and dairy diets.  The global number of children  under [five / two] who are  stunted (as a result of  malnutrition) has been reduced  by [70]% in 2030 relative to the  2010 baseline. By 2050, no  country has any child stunting  beyond levels occurring in  normal populations.r  Anemia in non-pregnant women  of reproductive age has been  reduced by [50]% in 2025  (relative to a baseline set in the  1993 - 2005 period)136.  Target 1a and its indicators recognize that agriculture-led growth is essential for ending poverty, food  insecurity and malnutrition. Although it has also been proposed to have a separate Goal on food security  and nutrition126, the SDSN proposes to include hunger and malnutrition under extreme poverty (Goal 1)  with the rationale that both are challenges that affect rural as well as urban areas; hunger is not only a  function of food availability; stunting and malnutrition are key dimensions of extreme poverty; and a  single  poverty/hunger  goal  ensures  full  continuity  with  the  current  MDG  1125.  Continuing  on  current  growth  trends,  about  5%  of  people  will  be  in  extreme  poverty  by  2030.  Hence,  with  slightly  faster  growth it should be possible to eradicate extreme poverty126. GDP growth from agriculture is at least  twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth generated in the non-agricultural sectors74.  Considering  the huge importance of food prices (relative to income) for eradicating poverty, another indicator could  be defined that would relate food prices to incomes of different income segments15. It could provide  some improvement over the first two indicators as it would allow for the immediate short term effects  of food price spikes on real incomes and food security.  Food and nutritional security in target 1a has four dimensions:    Supply: availability of enough food from diverse sources to meet the consumption needs of a  healthy  and  nutritious  diets,  by  either  feeding  oneself  directly  from  productive  land  or  other  natural resources, or well-functioning distribution, processing and market systems.                                                               r The World Health Assembly has endorsed a target aiming for a 40% reduction of the global number of children under five who  are stunted by 2025, which we extrapolate here to 70% by 2030 as an ambitious target. Actual targets will vary widely by  country, depending on current prevalence of stunting. Complete elimination of stunting is not possible, i.e., even in a healthy  population a small proportion of children will fall below the cut off.    30   Access: all members of society must have economic and physical access to sufficient food for a  healthy and nutritious diet, through their incomes or special programs.   Utilization: people must be able to absorb the food's nutrients. This involves sufficient intake,  diverse diets, good food preparation, intra-household distribution of food, access to clean water  and sanitation, and freedom from diseases and toxins that affect food utilization.    Stability:  year  round  and  year-to-year  stability  of  the  food  supply,  as  well  as  access  and  utilization of safe and nutritious food provides the foundation of food and nutritional security137.  A  broader  vision  of  modern  agriculture  recognizes  that  solutions  for  reducing  poverty  and  increasing  incomes also need to be nutrition- and equity-sensitive. Beyond food staples we must ensure a stable  and affordable supply of diverse micronutrient dense foods, such as legumes, pulses, vegetables, fruits,  dairy  and  livestock  and  aquatic  resources,  thereby  contributing  to  a  more  balanced  healthy  diet.  Through  a  variety  of  innovations  such  as  agronomic  biofortification  by  adding  micronutrients  to  fertilizers, biofortification breeding, or the promotion of vegetable gardens agriculture can improve food  quality  and  health.  Agricultural  productivity  improvements  also  provide  increased  income  and  employment  opportunities  that  improve  access  to  more  nutritious  food.  Multi-sector  interventions  including household food security and dietary diversity are most efficient in reducing child stunting138.  We propose four indicators that address the major hunger and malnutrition problems that need to be  overcome  in  our  generation,  recognizing  that  many  of  the  commonly  used  indices  and  measurement  systems  for  food  and  nutritional  security  have  shortcomings134,139.  A  calorie  availability/deprivation  indicator  of  some  kind  is  probably  still  needed  to  measure  extreme  forms  of  food  insecurity  (undernourishment), but also because traditionally used ones such as the FAO index have a long history  and reference base at national level. However, the nutritional relevance of calorie availability indicators  is  not  always  clear.  The  currently  used  methods,  based  on  national  food  balance  sheets  (FAO)  or  household consumption surveys, all face sizeable measurement errors and limitations in terms of cross- country  comparability,  upscaling,  disaggregation,  and  sensitivity  to  supply  shocks.  Measurement  of  hunger  could  probably  be  best  obtained  by  collecting  anthropometric  data  on  stunted  children139  or  dietary  diversity  indicators  that  are  powerful  predictors  of  economic  status  and  malnutrition  (both  stunting and wasting). Both should be part of designing new monitoring systems at different scales134.   Nutritional  interventions  should  focus  on  overcoming  malnutrition  in  women  of  reproductive  age  (particularly before and during pregnancy), and in children in the first 2 years of life57. For Goals 1 and 5,  we  recommend  adopting  and  extrapolating  the  six  targets  (and  indicators)  for  maternal,  infant  and  under the age of 5 nutrition that have recently been endorsed by the World Health Assembly. They can  be translated into realistic national targets based on the country-specific context140:   40% reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by 2025    50% reduction of anemia in non-pregnant women of reproductive age by 2025    30% reduction of low birth weight by 2025    No increase in the prevalence of overweight in children under five by 2025    Increase  the  rate  of  exclusive  breastfeeding  without  supplementary  feedings  in  the  first  six  months to reach at least 50% by 2025    Reduce childhood wasting to less than 5% by 2025 and maintain it below that level   Child  stunting  is  a  robust,  non-specific  indicator  of  nutritional  status  and  overall  health,  including  quantity  and  quality  of  dietary  intake  (mother  &  child),  pre-  and  post-natal  exposure  to  infections,  environmental challenges, and care giving. It is linked to other adverse outcomes such as child mortality,  delayed  development,  and  lower  wages  as  an  adult135,139.  Anemia  in  women  of  reproductive  age  is  another important nutrition-related indicator. Anemia is closely linked to maternal mortality and other  31  health  risks.  It  is  a  multi-factorial  disorder  caused  mainly  by  iron  deficiency  and  infections  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  by  deficiencies  of  vitamin  A,  vitamin  B12,  folate  and  riboflavin135.  Novel  metrics  that  measure  nutritional  diversity  in  cropping  systems  could  also  be  considered  for  defining  a  nutrition  indicator that could be of particular relevance for smallholder farming areas141.  GOAL 5: ACHIEVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING AT ALL AGES  Achieve  universal  health  coverage  at  every  stage  of  life,  with  particular  emphasis  on  primary  health  services, including reproductive health, to ensure that all people receive quality health services without  suffering  financial  hardship.  All  countries  promote  policies  to  help  individuals  make  healthy  and  sustainable decisions regarding diet, physical activity, and other individual or social dimensions of health.  Target 5c. Promote healthy diets and physical activity, discourage unhealthy behaviors, such as  smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and track subjective wellbeing and social capital.*  Possible Indicators  Share of calories  from non-staple  foods (%)  Aspirational outcomes  The share of calories from non- staple foods has increased by  [20]% by 2030 relative to a  2015 baseline.  Comments  Similar to the indicator proposed for Target 1a, this  simple dietary diversity indicator could be used to  track progress towards healthier diets in general,  including in developed countries. For that purpose, it  should be monitored at household level and  disaggregated by income, gender, age, etc.    Per capita meat  consumption (kg per  capita)  Fraction of calories  from added  saturated fats and  sugars (%)  Prevalence of  overweight and  obese children under  the age of [5] years  (% or annual rate of  change)  Diet indicator that could be applied to track progress  towards consuming less energy-intensive food in  countries where a reduction in meat consumption is a  major goal. Given the different nutritional and  environmental impacts of consuming white (chicken,  fish) or red (beef, pork, etc.) meat, this indicator could  also focus on red meat only. In a different context, it  could also be applied as a nutrition-related indicator in  countries with low animal protein consumption and  malnutrition.   [0]% increase or [x]% decrease  in per capita [red] meat  consumption by 2025 relative  to a 2015 baseline in countries  with currently high per capita  [red] meat consumption.  Saturated fats and sugars are found naturally in some  foods, but are often added when foods are processed  by food companies or when they are prepared. This  diet indicator could be used to limit and even reduce  the health burdens from added saturated fats and  sugars in processed foods.  Child Growth Standards) in children under age 5135.  Share of overweight (weight-for-height above two  standard deviations from the median of the WHO  Alternatively, this indicator could also be defined as  prevalence of overweight and obesity at all ages, or  using the Body Mass Index (BMI) as a metric.  Overweight is difficult to measure during early age,  with less reliable reference data available. Hence, this  indicator could also be measured for adolescent girls  and women of child-bearing age, since that affects not  only mothers but their children too.  [0]% increase or [x]% decrease  in the fraction of calories from  added saturated fats and  sugars by 2025 relative to a  2015 baseline.  [0]% increase in the prevalence  of overweight in children under  [five], girls and/or adolescent  girls and women of child- bearing age by 2025.   32  Prevalence of food  contamination  in the  food system [to be  defined]  to  track  indicator  could  be  defined  food  An  contamination  caused  by  mycotoxins ,  microbes  or  other food safety issues. This indicator would provide  an  incentive  to  put  surveillance  systems  in  place  to  monitor food safety and support farmers, traders and  processors in reducing contaminants.   To be defined.   Indicators for target 5c could address various aspects of the grand-scale behavioral changes required to  make  a  difference  towards  healthier,  less  energy-intensive  food  baskets,  with  particular  emphasis  on  reducing meat and sugar consumption among affluent consumers. Education is needed to ensure that  the growing population understands the components of a healthy, balanced diet. Recent examples focus  on  obesity  and  Type-II  diabetes,  including  national  social  sensitization  programs  such  as  the  USDAs  dietary guidelines, the 5-a-day program in the UK (where consumption of at least five portions of fruit  and vegetables is promoted) and public service programs from both the health/medical and agriculture  sectors. The education sector must have a strong role in ensuring that children are involved, as evidence  shows that good eating and healthy habits start early. In resource-limited contexts, women often lack  the  knowledge,  time  or  capability  to  provide  balanced  and  adequate  nutrition  to  their  children.  Agricultural  and  household  drudgery  can  demand  so  much  of  womens  time  that  they  are  unable  to  devote adequate time to childcare. In these contexts, effective interventions must engage men as well  as women and children to reduce drudgery in agriculture or re-balance workloads and diets.  Reducing excess per capita meat consumption - that of \"red\" meat (from livestock as compared with  chicken and fish) in particular - should be a major goal in those countries where it is among the major  causes of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and overweight and obesity. In addition to health benefits,  this would also reduce the pressure on grain production and many environmental issues, and thus allow  meeting the targets of Goals 6, 8 and 9. Hence, a suitable indicator could be defined for this purpose, for  countries  to  set  ambitious  targets  depending  on  their  current  consumption  levels.  The  prevalence  of  overweight in children under the age of five years has been steadily growing in the past 20 years, at an  annual  rate  of  3  to  5%57,135.  Preventive  interventions  should  combine  healthy  dietary  practices  (e.g.,  breastfeeding  and  a  diet  rich  in  fruits,  vegetables,  nuts,  dairy  products  and  whole  grains  and  low  in  sugar-sweetened beverages) and increased level of physical activity. Overweight and obesity affect all  age groups, but an immediate objective could be to measure it in young children or adolescent girls and  women of child-bearing age for early identification of children at risk of overweight, and undertaking  early  corrective  actions.  If  a  country  achieves  no  worsening  of  maternal  obesity  (Target  5c)  and  improvement  in  maternal  anemia  (Target  1a),  many  other  health  and  gender-related  targets  will  be  achieved.  In  most  countries  data  on  diet,  for  example,  is  almost  nonexistent.  Hence,  each  country  should establish and maintain a national health and nutrition survey.     33  GOAL 6: IMPROVE AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS AND RAISE RURAL PROSPERITY  Improve farming practices, rural infrastructure, and access to resources for food production to increase  the productivity of agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, raise smallholder incomes, reduce environmental  impacts, create better jobs, promote rural prosperity, and ensure resilience to climate change.   Target 6a. Ensure sustainable food production systems with high yields and high efficiency of water,  nutrients, and energy, supporting nutritious diets with low food losses and waste.  Possible Indicators  Cereal yield growth  rate (% p.a.)  Aspirational outcomes  Annual yield growth rate of  major food crops approaches  or exceeds [1.5]% by 2020.  Crop yield gap (actual  yield as % of yield  potential)  Livestock and fish  productivity growth  [to be defined]  Full-chain nitrogen  [phosphorus] use  efficiency (% or rate  of progress relative  to a defined gap to  close)  Comments  Annual yield growth rate of major cereals (maize, rice,  wheat, others), expressed in % or kg/ha harvested  land. These crops are fundamental for achieving food  and nutritional security. This indicator is critical for  assessing whether investments in productivity growth  of major food crops have the desired results. It could  be disaggregated by cereal crops and sub-national  scales, to verify progress against specific targets by  crops and regions.  Actual yield expressed as % of (water-limited) yield  potential is a benchmark for productivity that also  shows the exploitable yield gap95. It can be  disaggregated by crops of highest priority for a  country and is suitable for spatial disaggregation, from  local to global scales. This indicator requires improved  data collection and monitoring systems.  A suitable indicator should be defined that expresses  progress being made towards more efficient and  sustainable production of animal products. The  broader Livestock Production Index used by the World  Bank is insufficiently nuanced for this, because it  includes meat and milk from all sources, but also  other dairy products, eggs, honey, raw silk, wool, and  hides/skins.   Defined as the ratio of nutrients in final products (e.g.,  human food consumed) to new nutrient inputs into  terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric cycles (e.g.,  nitrogen from chemical synthesis or biological N  fixation, minerals mined and applied as fertilizers,  etc.)41.  It takes into account livestock and other  stages of the food chain, as well as recycling. This  indicator could track improvements in nutrient  efficiencies along the full chain in countries with low  efficiency levels. Because of different contexts,  specific targets would have to be country-specific, i.e.,  defined so as to reduce the gap between current and  targeted full-chain nutrient use efficiency levels.  This  indicator could also be disaggregated further, for  example for major food systems (chains). A  backcasting approach should be applied to identify  technology and policy options for achieving specific  full-chain efficiency targets.  The majority of farms achieve  [80]% of the attainable water- limited yield potential by 2030.  Livestock and aquaculture  productivity in developing  countries has doubled by 2030,  especially in Sub-Saharan  Africa.  Full-chain efficiency of nitrogen  and phosphorus has increased  by [x]% relative to current  levels in each country with sub- optimal efficiency (e.g., high  nutrient consumption relative  to actual yield). For countries  with low full-chain efficiency an  aspirational target could be to  reach, by 2030, a 30% increase  relative to current levels.   34  Crop nitrogen use  efficiency (%)   Access to irrigation  (%)  Crop water  productivity (tons of  harvested product  per unit irrigation  water)  Share of agricultural  produce loss and  food waste (% of  food production)    Defined as the ratio of nitrogen in harvested crop  products to the amount of nitrogen applied (per  cropping season or year). It is directly related to the  efficiency of fertilizer use on agricultural land,  including new technologies and stewardship programs  targeting farmers and advisors41. Interpretation and  specific targets for crop nitrogen use efficiency are  context-specific, primarily depending on yield, current  nitrogen use, soil quality and other factors.   Share of farmers or crop area with access to irrigation.  Irrigation is an essential component of achieving food  and nutritional security and reducing vulnerability in  crop production. Many countries, also in Sub-Saharan  Africa, have substantial potential for expanding  irrigated agriculture in a sustainable manner.  Concerns about unsustainable  water consumption  and depletion of water resources need to be  addressed through additional indicators.  The proposed indicator is directly related to  freshwater use for irrigation. Another alternative is to  define water productivity as the efficiency with which  water is converted to harvested product, i.e., the ratio  between yield and seasonal water supply, including  rainfall and irrigation95.   Methods developed by FAO could be the basis for this  indicator, but they need to be improved further and  first be applied to create a baseline83. Staple crops  that are often consolidated after harvest for  processing will provide better data for assessment of  losses to provide a baseline.  Crops grown on a small  scale and consumed at household level will be very  difficult to quantify in this sense, but are often those  most affected by crop losses.  Crop nitrogen efficiency  increased by [30]% relative to  current levels in countries with  low efficiency. Unsustainable  soil nutrient depletion halted  and reversed in countries with  insufficient nutrient use,  resulting in increased crop  production and economic  return.  The share of irrigated  agricultural land has increased  by [x]% in countries with  unexploited water resources.  Water productivity of crop  production has increased by  [30]% in countries with high  water use for irrigation.  Post-harvest  losses  and  food  waste  have  been  reduced  by  [30]%  in  2030  and  by  [50]%  in  2050 relative to current levels.   Target 6b. Halt forest and wetland conversion to agriculture, protect soil and land resources, and  ensure that farming systems are resilient to climate change and disasters.  Possible Indicators  Annual change in  forest area (% p.a.)  Comments  Similar to the current MDG 7 indicator 7.1, but  proposed to focus on the rate of change at national,  sub-national and local levels to guide policy making  and monitor implementation, including the use of  high-resolution remote sensing.  This indicator could  also be expressed in absolute terms (square  kilometers of forest area). Forest area is land under  natural or planted stands of trees, excluding tree  stands in agricultural production systems (e.g.,  plantations, agroforestry systems) and trees in urban  parks and gardens. The indicator could be expanded  to also include wetlands or other critical ecosystems.  Aspirational outcomes  [0]% annual forest conversion  to crop or livestock agriculture  by 2030. All countries have  policies and enforcement  systems in place to protect  their most critical natural  ecosystems.  35  Rate of change in  arable land area (%  p.a.)  Land area without  major constraints to  agriculture (% or ha,  or net rate of change)  Proportion of farmers  (or rural  communities)  covered by flood,  drought and heat  protection systems  (%)  Defined by FAO as land under temporary crops  (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary  meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under  market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily  fallow. This indicator could track expansion of  agriculture into natural ecosystems as well as the loss  of productive agricultural land to housing, industry,  roads and other uses, which may threaten a country's  food security.  Agricultural land not affected by [x] major soil fertility  constraints or land degradation, based on established  soil and land assessment methods and utilizing new  digital mapping and monitoring efforts142,143. Based on  a globally harmonized methodology, countries could  define their own minimum list of specific land  constraints that need to be tracked with regard to  achieving land degradation neutrality or even  improvement of land quality. The latter is important  for countries that need to overcome major soil or land  quality constraints, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa.   An indicator could be defined to quantify the  proportion of farmers that have access to/have  adopted new stress tolerant varieties and other  resilience-enhancing technologies and/or are covered  by policies, alert systems, crop insurance and other  preparedness measures in areas that are most at risk  to suffer from extreme climatic events .  [0]% annual change in [fertile]  arable land area by 2030.   [0]% net land degradation by  2030, i.e., achieve a land  degradation neutral world.  At least [30]% of farmers have  adopted soil and water- conserving production  practices and all farmers have  access to stress-tolerant,  adapted varieties. All countries  have policies, alert systems,  insurance solutions, social  safety nets, and other  preparedness measures in  place by 2030 to support  farmers in years when crops or  animals suffer.  Target 6c. Ensure universal access in rural areas to basic resources and infrastructure services (land,  water, sanitation, modern energy, transport, mobile and broadband communication, agricultural  inputs, and advisory services).  Possible Indicators  Proportion of  smallholder farmers  with secure rights to  land (%)  Comments  Secure land tenure is a key determinant for  implementing sustainable agricultural intensification  measures. This indicator could express land tenure  status as the percentage of farmers (households) who  have secure, permanent ownership or affordable long- term lease of the land they farm, disaggregated by  region, income and gender. Women in particular need  to be given better access to land, which should also be  tracked with this indicator.  Aspirational outcomes  At least [80]% of all farmers  have secure ownership or  affordable long-term leases of  the land they farm.  36     Access to improved  water source in rural  areas (%)  Access to improved  sanitation (%)  Rural electrification  rate (%)   Access to paved  roads (% access  within [x] km  distance to road)  Access to drying,  storage and  processing facilities  [to be defined]  Broadband mobile  phone subscribers in  rural areas (%)  Proportion of rural  households with  access to low-interest  credit (%)  Similar to current MDG7 indicator 7.8, but following  the World Bank definition. Percentage of the  population with reasonable access to an adequate  amount of water from an improved source, such as a  household connection, public standpipe, borehole,  protected well or spring, and rainwater collection.  Reasonable access is defined as the availability of at  least 20 liters a person a day from a source within one  kilometer of the dwelling.  Percentage of households with access to effective  sanitation.  Sanitation is a critical part of public health  and impacts agriculture; poor sanitation reduces  household health due to infection and poor sanitation  can affect the water source for communities as well as  for agricultural production and postharvest value  addition, thus compromising the health of consumers.  Percentage of rural households with access to  electricity, either through traditional grids, micro-grids  (village level), or household supply (ex. rooftop solar).  Data should be disaggregated as to whether the  source is renewable or not to track progress on  targets for renewable energy. Electricity is critical for  cost-efficient agriculture as well as effective  processing and storage of agricultural produce.  Access to paved roads is critical for many rural  development processes, including access to inputs,  markets, education, and health services. This indicator  could be defined as percentage of rural households  who are within [x] km of good quality paved roads  (and/or rail) that provide connectivity to markets.  Good infrastructure for drying and storing agricultural  produce is critical for high quality and value as well as  for reducing losses and contamination by mycotoxins  or other food contaminants. Rural processing capacity  would provide employment opportunities, enhance  access to markets, and facilitate value addition  (including the production of foods to enhance  infant/child nutrition and reduce maternal drudgery).   Combines MDG8 indicators 8.15 and 8.16; total  number or percentage of rural households (or people)  who have pre- or post-paid cellular phone  subscriptions with broadband connectivity. The  indicator emphasizes broadband access as a key  means for internet connectivity and thus access to  more information and services.  Access to affordable credit at the right time is critical for  farmers to buy the inputs and services needed. It is also  critical for many small and medium-size rural enterprises,  including many run by women. This indicator could be  defined as percentage of rural households who have  access to sufficient financing at interest rates below [x]%.  Alternatively, it could also be defined as the average  rural lending rate.  At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  good quality water sources.   At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  improved sanitation.  At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  affordable electricity.   At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  good quality roads connecting  them with local markets.   At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  affordable local drying, storage  and processing facilities.   At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have broadband  internet connectivity.   At least [80]% of all households  in rural areas have access to  low-interest financing for  critical agricultural capital,  inputs and services.   37  Doing business in  agriculture index or  indicators  Agricultural extension  professionals per  1000 farmers  Employment rate of  rural youth and  women (%)  Further refining the \"Doing Business\" indicator used  by the World Bank, an index or indicators could track  different areas of the investment climate for   small and medium agribusinesses, i.e., areas where  policy reforms are most needed to stimulate business  growth (inputs, farm services , land, water, finance,  insurance, transport and markets, etc.).   Without a functioning public/private extension system  it is not possible to succeed with SAI. An indicator  should be defined that tracks the total number of  qualified agricultural professionals across different  sectors that provide training, information and other  extension support and services to farmers and small  to medium enterprises in rural value chains. This  indicator should include professionals with a minimum  level of education/training/certification working in the  public, private and civil society sectors.  Related to Target 3c. Percentage of young people (age  15-24) and women employed in rural areas,  disaggregated by region and income. A youth and  women employment indicator would track progress  being made in creating new, better jobs in rural areas.   To be identified. Discussions on  developing new indicators are  currently underway in the  \"Benchmarking the business of  agriculture\" initiative, in  response to a G8 call.  All farmers have access to  quality agricultural advisory  services that provide locally  relevant knowledge,  information and other services.  [50]% increase in rural youth  and women employment  through the creation of new  and better jobs in agricultural  value chains and service sectors  in rural areas.  The indicators and aspirational outcomes proposed for Targets 6a-c reflect multiple dimensions involved  in  implementing  SAI,  including  genetic,  agro-ecological  and  socioeconomic  innovations  and  the  necessary enabling systems (Fig. 2-1). Growth in agricultural production can come from area expansion  or intensification (increasing yield or cropping intensity per unit of agricultural land). Reliance on area  expansion  in  Latin  America  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa  must  be  limited,  whereas  in  many  parts  of  Asia,  North America and Europe critical resources such as water and mineral fertilizers need to be managed  more  efficiently.  Future  growth  in  crop  production  will  have  to  come  from  existing  land  whenever  possible, by increasing yields and reducing losses and waste. This will be a primary requisite for reducing  the  expansion  of  agriculture  into  natural  ecosystems  and  thus  for  achieving  Target  6b.  However,  increasing  productivity  through  SAI  by  itself  may  often  not  be  sufficient  to  spare  natural  ecosystems  from destruction144. Increasing profits may result in an incentive for conversion of natural ecosystems to  agriculture, e.g., forests. Hence, other instruments to use include comprehensive conservation policies,  land-use  planning  and  adequate  governance,  including  carefully  crafted  and  enforced  protection  of  critical natural ecosystems.   Simultaneously  we  will  have  to  address  unsustainable  extraction  of  freshwater  resources,  increase  nutrient  efficiency  and  adapt  to  climate  change9.  Similarly,  increases  in  production  of  animal  source  foods  need  to  come  primarily  from  increased  productivity  per  animal  rather  than  increased  animal  numbers. Any slowdown in productivity growth would mean that more land, water, energy, fertilizer,  pesticides, labor and other inputs would be needed to meet the rising food demand, thus also raising  the  cost  of  food3,5.  The  plateauing  of  cereal  yields  in  intensive  production  systems  needs  to  be  overcome, yield gaps will have to be closed in both the crop and livestock components of smallholder  agricultural  systems  of  the  developing  world,  and  incentives  need  to  be  provided  for  protecting  soil  resources. All this requires sensitive, measurable indicators that can track progress in these areas.  Other  interesting  options  for  indicators  for  target  6a  should  be  explored.  Since  many  biofuel  crops  directly compete with food production and also have other sustainability issues145, an indicator could be   38  defined  that  reflects  the  need  to  restrain  the  use  of  land  for  biofuels  relative  to  food  production.  Moreover,  an  indicator  such  as  the  annual  growth  in  Total  Factor  Productivity  (TFP)  could  capture  productivity growth as a whole, and has been used more widely in recent years5. Other indicators  could measure the productivity of agricultural labor or land relative to the agricultural value produced  and  cereal  prices15.  They  could  also  be  disaggregated  by  sub-sector  (crops  and  livestock).  The  use  of  value  addition  (in  cereal  equivalents)  rather  than  gross  production  in  all  these  measures  allows  for  technical  and  economic  efficiency,  for  the  effects  of  large  changes  in  real  staple  food  prices,  and  for  value differences across different agricultural products. The availability of reliable data at sub-national  to district level will largely determine which indicators can be used.  In conjunction with the targets for Goal 9, target 6b focuses on critical natural resources for agriculture  or affected by agriculture, including soil and land resources that form the basis for food security. The  demand for fertile soil is increasing as the world population grows and is moving up the food chain. The  mostly  policy  driven  bioenergy  sector  has  further  increased  the  demand  for  agricultural  land.  On-site  effects of soil degradation contribute to food insecurity and limit rural development. Off-site effects of  soil  degradation  such  as  sedimentation  of  reservoirs  and  streambeds,  eutrophication  of  waterbodies  caused by erosion and CO2 emissions caused by soil organic matter loss do not stop at national borders.  Avoiding  soil  degradation  and  restoring  degraded  soils  need  to  be  addressed  at  a  global  as  well  as  national level. The Rio+20 outcome document proposed to aim for a land degradation neutral world in  which any land degradation has to be minimized and  any unavoidable land degradations needs to be  offset  by  regeneration  (a  natural  process  without  human  effort)  and  restoration  (an  active  process  induced by human effort). The third indicator proposed for target 6b tries to capture this, but others  could be defined, including a more specific one that focuses on soil fertility constraints, for example147.  The  sustainable  development  path  requires  a  re-thinking  of  rural  development  and  smallholder  agriculture towards structural transformations that include and benefit the poor  through new farming  systems, technologies and business models that allow overcoming land constraints and enable greater  market  participation,  thus  creating  new  job  opportunities75,148-150.  We  propose  several  indicators  for  target 6c that could address this. A land tenure indicator would track ownership/secure lease of land,  which is one of the major constraints faced by farmers in developing countries. Insecurity about land  prevents many from investing in productivity-enhancing measures. It is a prerequisite for implementing  SAI  and  making  use  of  modern  technologies.  Without  secure  tenure  to  land,  hundreds  of  millions  of  smallholders  will  not  be  able  to  access  credit  or  make  major  investments  in  soil  improvement,  machinery  or  other  critical  technologies.  The  Voluntary  Guidelines  on  the  Responsible  Governance  of  Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, which were developed  through  widespread  global  consultations  and  adopted  by  the  Committee  on  World  Food  Security  in  2012, provide helpful guidance on securing land tenure151.  Sustainable agricultural intensification along whole value chains is an engine of socially inclusive growth  in rural areas, giving a boost to smallholder farmers and new rural businesses along the value chain. The  agriculture  and  food  sector  plays  a  key  role  in  rural  job  creation,  particularly  for  women  and  youth.  Interventions aimed at improving access to markets, improved technologies and productive assets are  key  to  enhancing  smallholder  participation  in  value  chains  and  thus  escaping  poverty  traps  and  subsistence  farming149.  Equitable,  sustainable  development  requires  recognizing  the  potential  of  rural  areas  by  making  villages  and  towns  places  that  offer  well-paid  work  and  support  proper  education,                                                               s Soil degradation is not fully avoidable. Soil erosion rates on arable land for example are typically one or two orders of  magnitude higher that soil reproduction rates.146   39  health  and  cultural  infrastructure.  To  allow  farmers  and  small  rural  enterprises  to  participate  in  the  market, governments have to direct greaterinvestments to rural transport, energy provision, irrigation,  water supply, sanitation services, communication, prompt dissemination of information and improved  crop  storage  infrastructure.  Professional  agricultural  advisory  services  will  play  a  major  role  in  implementing SAI. New models must be found to speed up the  delivery of new technologies through  public and private sector channels. In addition to professional advisory services, farmers need their own  innovation and knowledge-sharing networks which can link strategically to such services.  GOAL 8: CURB HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENSURE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY   Curb greenhouse gas emissions from energy, industry, agriculture, the built environment, and land-use  change to ensure a peak of global CO2 emissions by 2020 and to head off the rapidly growing dangers of  climate change. Promote sustainable energy for all.  Target 8b. Reduce non-energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases through improved practices in  agriculture, forestry, waste management, and industry.  Possible Indicators  Greenhouse gas  emissions from  agriculture (tons  CO2-equivalent per  unit food-equivalent  produced)  Aspirational outcomes  GHG emissions from agriculture  reduced by [30]% relative to  current levels (per unit food- equivalent).  Comments  Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture,  including direct and indirect emissions from crop and  livestock production, forestry and associated land use  changes; based on a new FAO database providing a  complete and coherent time series of emission  statistics over a reference period 19612010 at country  level, using FAOSTAT (http://faostat.fao.org) activity  data and IPCC methodology 152. The IPCC Tier 1  approach has high uncertainty because it is heavily  based on global default emission factors.  Hence, this  indicator should be improved by utilizing country- specific emission factors that are increasingly becoming  available (Tier 2 approach).   In agriculture, a range of management practices can  make substantial contributions to reducing GHG  emissions, e.g., adoption of management practices to  increase soil carbon sequestration, nutrient  stewardship programs that reduce nitrous oxide  emissions, or management practices that reduce  methane emissions from rice or livestock.  Depending  on data availability and reliability, an indicator could be  defined to track the adoption of such measures or their  total impact on GHG-savings at different scales.     Adoption of GHG- saving management  practices in  agriculture (% area  under GHG-saving  management  practices or tons of  CO2-equivalent)   Adoption of GHG-saving  management practices has  increased to [x]% of the  agricultural area.  Food  systems  as  a  whole  contribute  about  2030%  of  global  anthropogenic  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  releasing  10-17  Gt  CO2  equivalent  in  200831.  Agricultural  production,  including  indirect  emissions associated with land-cover change, contributes 80% to 86% of total food system emissions,  with significant regional variation31. There are many opportunities for reducing GHG emissions on both  the demand and the supply sides of the global food system153,154, including some triple win solutions  that  could  contribute  to  mitigation,  adaptation,  and  improved  food  security120.  Investment  in  yield  improvements is among the most important mitigation strategies. It has been estimated that that each  dollar invested in agricultural yields has resulted in 249 fewer kg CO2-equivalent emissions relative to  1961 technology, avoiding 13.1 Gt CO2-equivalent per year155. Hence, an indicator for target 8b should  be a yield adjusted indicator, expressing GHG emissions per ton of product produced, which is more   40  consistent with SAI principles than an indicator tracking gross GHG emission from agriculture. This would  also allow taking differences among countries into account. A populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa in  which  population  will  double  by  2050  can  probably  not  be  expected  to  reduce  gross  greenhouse  gas  emissions from agriculture compared to present. Data availability and reliability will by and large drive  what indicators to use.  Other indicators for Target 8b could be defined to more specifically track the adoption of climate-smart  agriculture  technologies  contributing  to  mitigation  of  GHG,  for  example  carbon  sequestration  in  agricultural soils and trees156, nutrient management stewardship programs that contribute to reducing  nitrous oxide emissions, or water-saving irrigation to reduce methane emissions from rice157, provided  that reliable and affordable mechanisms for scientific verification, implementation and monitoring can  be established. Effective policy and business mechanisms need to be created to allow participation of  farmers in recognized global, regional and national GHG reduction schemes, thus providing additional  incentives  for  adopting  resource-conserving  production  practices  that  can  reduce  GHG  emissions,  but  also increase productivity, input efficiency and/or lower production costs.   GOAL 9: SECURE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND BIODIVERSITY, AND ENSURE GOOD MANAGEMENT OF  WATER AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES  Biodiversity, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems of local, regional, and global significance are inventoried,  managed, and monitored to ensure the continuation of resilient and adaptive life support systems and to  support  sustainable  development.  Water  and  other  natural  resources  are  managed  sustainably  and  transparently to support inclusive economic and human development.   Target 9a. Ensure resilient and productive ecosystems by adopting policies and legislation that  address drivers of ecosystem degradation, and requiring individuals, businesses and governments to  pay the social cost of pollution and use of environmental services.  Possible Indicators  Genetic diversity of  terrestrial  domesticated  animals  Aspirational outcomes  The adopting of cross breeds  with improved genetics has  increased by [x]% and the  genetic diversity of  domesticated animals farmed  has increased by [x]% relative  to current levels.  The genetic diversity of  cultivated crops farmed has  been effectively conserved and  is widely utilized in crop  improvement programs.  Deposition of non-indigenous  nutrients on natural  ecosystems (terrestrial and  aquatic) has been reduced by  at least [30]% relative to  current levels, with several  countries going further to  reach levels that are not  detrimental to ecosystem  Comments  In the absence of direct measures at genetic level, the  status of domestic breed populations provides the  best available indication of trends in diversity. This  indicator is based on the Domestic Animal Diversity  Information System of FAO (DAD-IS,  dad.fao.org).  DAD-IS covers more than 30 species  used for food and agriculture and includes data on the  size and structure of breed populations.   www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals  A suitable indicator could be defined to track the  status of conservation of critical crop genetic  resources and its utilization in crop improvement  programs.   This indicator could complement the nutrient  efficiency indictors proposed for Target 6a by focusing  more explicitly on direct losses of biologically and  chemically reactive nutrient forms that are caused by  various mechanisms from fertilizer, human and animal  waste, industry, or organic amendments. They often  result in transport of such compounds by air or water  to distant areas. In nutrient-limited ecosystems this  leads to eutrophication of freshwater streams, lakes  Genetic diversity of  cultivated plant  species [to be  defined]  Loss of reactive  nitrogen  [phosphorus] to the  environment  (kg/ha)  41  and coastal ecosystems, acidification of forests and  soils, and loss of biodiversity. This indicator is more  difficult to measure and mainly of interest to selected  countries in which high nutrient loads cause damage  to ecosystem functions.  www.bipindicators.net/nitrogenloss  function and biodiversity.   Target 9c. All governments and businesses commit to the sustainable, integrated, and transparent  management of water, agricultural land, forests, fisheries, mining, and hydrocarbon resources to  support inclusive economic development and the achievement of all SDGs.  Possible Indicators  Extent of forest and  forest types (%)  Coverage of  protected areas (% or  km2)  Proportion of fish  stock in safe  biological limits (%)  Annual water  withdrawal by  agriculture (million  cubic meters)  Share of land,  fisheries and forest  area covered by  responsible  governance policies  (%)   Comments  MDG7 indicator 7.1 and similar to the forest indicator  under Target 6b, but focusing on less regular, larger  scale assessment. The extent of forests is one of the  key indicators developed to track progress towards  MDG 7. Global assessments of the worlds forests are  currently carried out at 5 year intervals by FAO.  www.bipindicators.net/forestextent  This indicator could be expanded or supplemented  with other indicators to also track the extent and  quality other ecosystems, particularly wetlands.  Calculated using all designated protected areas  recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas  (WDPA) with a known size, including marine and  terrestrial protected areas. Global, regional and  national time series from 1872 onwards.  www.bipindicators.net/pacoverage  A measure of the sustainability of fishery resources in  the context of aquatic ecosystem sustainability. It  reflects fishery production and its social-economic  benefits, and can be used for the formulation of  fishery policy and the development of fishery  management plans. The FAO assessment classifies fish  stocks into three categories: overexploited, fully  exploited and under-exploited.  www.bipindicators.net/fishstocksinsafebiologicallimits  An indicator for the overall trends in water  consumption, measured at different scales (e.g.,  regional/basin, national, watershed, irrigation system).  It could also be defined as agriculture's share of total  water consumption or in relation to the amount of  water that can be used sustainably in an area.  Based on voluntary guidelines for responsible  governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests,  countries need to develop their own laws and  policies151. An indicator should be defined that tracks  progress in implementing such laws and guidelines.  Aspirational outcomes  By 2020, the rate of net loss of  all natural habitats, including  forests, is at least halved, and  where feasible brought close to  zero by 2030 (including land  reclaimed or reconverted from  agriculture to wetland or  forest). Degradation and  fragmentation is significantly  reduced.  At least [20]% of terrestrial and  inland water, and [15]% of  coastal and marine areas,  especially areas of importance  for biodiversity and ecosystem  services, are protected.  All fish stocks are managed and  legally harvested sustainably  within their biological limits,  applying ecosystem-based  approaches, so that overfishing  is avoided.  Water withdrawal for  agriculture is within agreed  limits to avoid unsustainable  withdrawal of water resources.  Laws and policies for  responsible governance of  tenure of land, fisheries and  forests are implemented on at  least [90]% of a country's land  area. Incentives harmful to  biodiversity are eliminated.  42  Share of extractive  industries income  spent on rural  development and  environmental  protection (%)  An indicator should be defined that tracks a country's  progress in utilizing income generated from extractive  industries to support rural (infrastructure)  development (Goal 6) and environmental protection  (Goal 9), i.e., measures that particularly benefit the  poor.  In low- or middle-income  countries, at least [20]% of a  country's income from  extractive industries and other  land development investments  is utilized to support socially  inclusive rural development  and environmental protection  measures.  In the medium to long term, farmers have no economic or other incentive to destroy the environment  they operate in. They care about the quality of their land, the quality and safety of food they produce,  and the environment. Notwithstanding this, agriculture can negatively impact the environment in many  ways132,158, and it plays a major role in ensuring that critical ecosystems on Earth are preserved, resilient  and fully functional. Concepts, tools, and mechanisms for valuing ecosystem services need to be fully  developed  and  they  need  to  lead  to  action,  including  participation  by  millions  of  smallholder  farmers  and  including  benefits  for  them.  Agricultural  ecosystems  must  be  managed  as  part  of  the  wider  landscape,  reinforcing  natural  resilience.  Successful  strategies  for  biodiversity  management  and  ecosystem preservation are complex to design and require coordinated policies over a long time frame.  They need to be based on science, but generally include a combination of voluntary guidelines, enforced  legal protection of critical natural ecosystems, social mobilization and changing business behavior.  The  proposed  SDG  Targets  9a  and  9c  in  conjunction  with  the  other  SDGs  cover  many  of  the  20  Aichi  Biodiversity  Targets  (www.cbd.int/sp/targets),  which  were  developed  under  the  Convention  for  Biological  Diversity  as  operational  milestones  to  be  achieved  by  2020.  We  generally  support  these  targets  and  extrapolate  some  of  them  to  2030.  However,  the  diversity  and  specificity  of  ecosystems  around  the  world  makes  it  difficult  to  select  just  a  few  outcome  targets  and  indicators  that  are  applicable  in  every  country.  Countries  need  to  achieve  locally-defined  targets  to  record  and  manage  their  key  ecosystems  by  adopting  policies  and  legislation  that  address  drivers  of  degradation  and  biodiversity loss, and require individuals, businesses, and governments to pay the social cost of pollution  and for the use of environmental services125. We only provide a few examples of possible indicators that  could be used to track the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Many more  have been proposed by numerous organizations to monitor multiple dimensions of ecosystem health in  agricultural  landscapes,  for  example  those  proposed  by  the  Biodiversity  Indicators  Partnership  (www.bipindicators.net).  Actual  usage  will  primarily  depend  on  data  availability  and  reliability,  which  would  require  substantial  investments  in  improving  current  monitoring  systems,  particularly  in  low- income and fragile countries.   Water use cuts across Goals 6 (Agriculture), 7 (Cities and Industry), and 9 (Ecosystems). Here we include  a  proposed  indicator  that  focuses  on  tracking  freshwater  use  by  agriculture,  as  the  largest  water- consuming sector. By 2050 over 40% of the world's population may be living in river basins experiencing  severe  water  stress159.  Many  countries  face  growing  water  stress  and  virtually  all  must  improve  the  integrated and sustainable management of their water resources. This will require long-term strategies  involving  governments,  communities,  and  businesses  to  balance  sustainable  supply  and  use,  reduce  water  loss,  improve  water  retention,  and  lower  pollution.  Regions,  countries  and  local  communities  need  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  peak  limits  to  freshwater  use,  in  order  to  develop  sound  policies and implementation guidelines for sustainable management and governance of water resources  at  different  scales160.  Following  recently  agreed  voluntary  guidelines  for  responsible  governance  of  tenure  of  land,  fisheries  and  forests151,  countries  should  craft  their  own  policies  to  ensure  equitable,  inclusive access by the rural poor to these critical resources.   43  Growth corridors driven by extractive industries (mining, hydrocarbons) as well as other agribusiness- driven large-scale land development schemes are penetrating rapidly into areas where agriculture has  been constrained by lack of resources and access to markets, particularly in Africa161,162. Although this  could  unleash  major  improvements  in  rural  infrastructure  and  expansion  of  arable  crops,  governance  weaknesses may also lead to environmental damage and further marginalization of poor smallholders.  Transparent  governance  and  management  of  these  developments  is  urgently  needed,  including  laws  and policies that ensure sustainable practices and equitable revenue sharing to support environmental  protection  and  rural  development.  Rural  and  agricultural  development  are  also  much  influenced  by  industries drawing rural labor into factories and industrial zones, the export of human capital to other  countries, and extractive industries (oil, gas, coal, minerals) as a mega sector of many economies. All of  these can be a significant source of investment for speeding up structural transformation in rural areas.  The  post-2015  agenda  will  need  to  find  creative  institutional  and  policy  instruments  to  harness  this  potential  to  advance  food  security  and  inclusive  rural  development,  including  suitable  indicators  that  capture these processes and their environmental impact.   GOAL 10: TRANSFORM GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  The public sector, business, and other stakeholders commit to good governance, including transparency,  accountability,  access  to  information,  participation,  an  end  to  tax  and  secrecy  havens,  and  efforts  to  stamp  out  corruption.  The  international  rules  governing  international  finance,  trade,  corporate  reporting,  technology,  and  intellectual  property  are  made  consistent  with  achieving  the  SDGs.  The  financing of poverty reduction and global public goods including efforts to head off climate change are  strengthened and based on a graduated set of global rights and responsibilities.   Target 10b. Adequate domestic and international public finance for ending extreme poverty,  providing global public goods, capacity building, and transferring technologies, including 0.7 percent  of GNI in ODA for all high-income countries, and an additional $100 billion per year in official climate  financing by 2020.  Possible Indicators  Share of  government  spending on  agriculture (%)  Aspirational outcomes  During the entire 2015-2030  period, all countries with an  agriculture-based economy  spend at least [10]% of their  national budgets on  supporting the agricultural  sector in their country.  During the entire 2015-2030  period, annual government  spending on agricultural  research and extension  increases by at least [5]% per  year in low- and medium- income countries;  agricultural research  intensity reaches at least  [1]% of agricultural GDP.  Comments  This indicator measures the proportion of the national  government budget spent on agriculture. It should also  measure the actual release or utilization of funds.  Because the share of agriculture in the overall economy  declines as countries move up the ladder, the targets for  this indicator may vary accordingly. African governments  in CAADP have agreed to increase public investment in  agriculture to a minimum of 10% of their national  budgets. The indicator could be further disaggregated to  track spending by sectors or specific target groups.  A  suitable  indicator  needs  to  be  defined  to  express  a  country's  agricultural  R&D  commitment,  with  specific  targets  to  be  set  by  each  country.  One  possibility  is  to  define  it  as  growth  rate  in  agricultural  R&D  spending.  Another   indicator  is  the  agricultural  research  intensity  ratio,  which  expresses  agricultural  research  spending  relative to agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) but  and  requires  in  the  Agricultural  Science  and  Technology  (ASTI)  database.  www.asti.cgiar.org  interpretation163.  Country  data  are  available  context-specific  target  setting  Agricultural R&D  spending (% change  p.a. or % of  agricultural GDP)    44  Share of ODA  spending on  agriculture (%)  Proportion of bilateral ODA funds allocated to agriculture  (including forestry and fisheries), including support for  R&D, human resources development, and institutional  capacity building. www.oecd.org/dac/stats  During the entire 2015-2030  period, all high-income  countries meet the 0.7% of  Gross National Income (GNI)  target for ODA, spend at  least [10]% of their ODA  funding on agriculture, and  spend an additional [x]% on  rural development.  Increasing  and  sustaining  investment  in  agriculture  and  food  systems  in  a  responsible  manner  is  essential for sustainable development. Both domestic government spending and Official Development  Assistance (ODA) play a key role in implementing the SAI agenda. Both require sustained commitments  to meet the minimum investment levels required, and those making critical decisions need to be well  informed and able to prioritize and target investments based on the best available evidence. Countries  need to set their own ambitious targets for agricultural and rural development. A combination of public  and private financing will be required to ensure full coverage of all investment needs in an equitable  manner.  Governments  must  lead  by  committing  to  strong  and  sustained  support  of  the  agricultural  sector. Most low-income countries and agriculture-based or transition economies, particularly those in  Sub-Saharan Africa, should aim to spend at least 10% of their national or state budgets on accelerating  agricultural growtht. Transparent principles and mechanisms are needed to ensure that farmers, small  producers and businesses  and women in particular - are at the center of the investment strategy and  also  benefit  from  investments  in  public  goods  such  as  infrastructure,  price  support  for  inputs  and  outputs, research and extension.  Investments  in  public  agricultural  research  should  receive  high  priority  and  be  of  a  more  long-term,  strategic nature. To be effective, national research and extension systems need to establish minimum  capacities across all relevant disciplines and major commodities. As private sector R&D is concentrated  on fewer commodities, technologies and markets than public R&D and the intellectual property created  is not equally accessible, this can be a transformational change. Globally, annual growth in agricultural  R&D spending averaged 2.4% for the period 2000-2008, but many low- to middle-income countries have  already accelerated their agricultural R&D spending to annual rates of 5% or more in recent years163. We  propose that this should be a minimum, sustained target for all developing countries, although some,  starting from a lower base, may have to do even more. Most low- to middle-income countries should  aim to spend at least 1% of their agricultural GDP on public agricultural R&D. New models for research  and  extension  systems  are  need  in  many  countries  to  also  ensure  better  focus  and  more  sustainable  funding. Farmer-driven research and extension models would ensure greater focus on issues important  to them.   Aid to agriculture from ODA programs by developed countries and multilateral agencies fell from about  US$ 11-12 billon in the mid-1980s to a little over US$ 5 billion in the mid-2000su. As a proportion of total  ODA  financing,  the  share  of  aid  to  agriculture  declined  from  17%  to  6%  during  the  same  period,  revealing a clear relative neglect of the sector164. Agricultural ODA funding has increased to over US$  10.5  billion  (current  value)  in  recent  years,  but  its  share  was  still  only  6.2%  of  total  ODA  in  2011  (www.oecd.org/dac/stats). ODA investments in agriculture need to accelerate to make up for nearly 20  years of neglect, and these higher investments need to continue over the long term. All donors need to  commit  to  meeting  minimum  targets.  In  2007-08,  just  three  countries  (the  United  States,  Japan  and                                                               t We cite this as an aspirational target based on what has been proposed in CAADP, www.nepad-caadp.net.  u The OECD analysis includes 22 DAC countries and 8 multilateral agencies.  45  France)  accounted  for  more  than  half  of  all  bilateral  aid  commitments  to  agriculture,  and  only  three  countries (Finland, France and Switzerland) allocated 10% or more of their ODA funds to agriculture. We  propose  that  all  donor  countries  should  meet  the  10%  agriculture  ODA  target,  and  that  donors  also  should  ensure  that  no  country  in  need  is  neglected.  Utilization  of  ODA  on  agriculture  should  be  monitored  in  a  transparent,  more  effective  manner  to  ensure  that  it  achieves  the  expected  results.  Target  10b  should  also  be  concerned  with  effective  and  efficient  use  of  available  domestic  and  international finance for agricultural development, for which an indicator could be defined.  Other indices can be used for scoring the broader performance of the agricultural sector and its changes  over time. Discussions are currently ongoing to develop a new Agricultural Transformation Index (ATI),  made up of sub-indices or component indicators which would provide actionable measures of country  performance  and  also  help  measure  aid  effectiveness  (www.agriculturaltransformationindex.org).  Agribusiness and investment climate, inclusiveness of policies, productivity, sustainability, and markets  could be among the performance areas to be included in such an index.   3.3. Improving metrics, data and access to information  Without  clear  metrics  and  a  well-designed  research  and  institutional  approach  to  make  the  metrics  operational, reaching the targets for sustainable development will remain an amorphous goal. Countries  must have the capacities to measure robust indicators of progress. Metrics for agriculture and nutrition  are  needed  that  steer  policy,  production,  and  consumption  decisions  along  a  course  that  will  lead  to  continuous improvements. Metrics are important for setting a baseline by which to measure progress;  tracking  and  anticipating  socioeconomic,  nutritional,  and  ecological  change;  diagnosing  constraints;  constructively  engaging  public,  private,  and  NGO  participants;  and  identifying  appropriate  policy  responses143.  Indicators  inform  action,  but  many  of  the  currently  used  metrics  are  inadequate  or  in  conflict with each other, obscuring clear guidelines for policymakers and practitioners. Unfortunately,  estimating even basic metrics on crop yields, prevalence rates and patterns of different aspects of food  security,  or  environmental  impact  remains  difficult91,134,165.  The  statistical  capacities  of  Sub-Saharan  African countries, for example, have fallen into disarray, resulting in numbers that substantially misstate  the  actual  state  of  affairs166.  Efforts  to  evaluate  the  cross-sectoral  performance  of  agriculture  are  currently  hugely  hampered  by  insufficient  data,  inconsistent  measurement  protocols,  uncertainties  about  the  right  scale  of  measurement,  weaknesses  in  models,  and  lack  of  investment  in  monitoring  systems that take full advantage of new technologies such as remote sensing.    Aggregate national data provided by international organizations such as FAO and The World Bank are  often used to capture agricultural production and input use, changes in land use, food supplies available  for consumption per capita, and average poverty rates that infer food access. These data typically fail to  account  for  in  food  production  and  consumption, shocks associated with weather and war, and uncertainties related to market and climate  dynamics. Local social characteristics, such as net producer vs. consumer status, education, and health,  are  absent  in  these  aggregate  metrics.  Ecological  change  related  to  soils,  water,  and  crop  genetic  diversity  is  not  measured  consistently  across  countries  at  scales  that  matter  for  private  sector  investment  and  policy  response.  Local  measures  of  economic,  social,  and  ecological  change,  when  implemented, are often costly, discontinuous over time, and inconsistent from one location to another.  Such measures can be useful for addressing specific problems at certain times and locations, but they  require significant scaling to be beneficial for monitoring regional and global food systems.   Developing a core set of agreed-upon indicators and collecting the necessary data in a systematic and  reliable  manner  is  a  matter  of  high  priority  and  will  require  substantial  investment  in  people  and  infrastructure,  including  new  information  technology.  From  a  policy  and  decision-making  standpoint,  income  distribution,  agricultural  waste,  seasonal  swings   46  information  would  be  most  useful  for  what  sorts  of  implementing  a  sustainable  agricultural  intensification in the future? In Chapter 3.2. we discussed - as examples - a set of indicators that could  be used to monitor the major outcomes of sustainable agricultural intensification (food and nutritional  security, economic and social development, and environmental sustainability) and some of the enabling  components required. Many of them fulfill the main requirements (Box 3-1), but some will also require  further  analysis  and  improvement.  Subsequently,  we  discuss  some  of  the  major  data  gaps  and  make  suggestions for how to gradually overcome them.  Box 3-1: Key consideration for metrics used in monitoring agriculture   Metrics must be well defined and meaningful (have a clear mechanistic meaning and relation to specific  development goals/targets), measurable, motivational for positive change, and easy to understand and to  communicate  to  those  who  need  to  be  the  agents  of  change  in  the  future:  farmers,  policy  makers,  executives, consumers, youth, etc.   Metrics  should  provide  cross-sectional  representation  and  thus  include  measurement  of  biophysical,  economic, social, and nutritional change.    Metrics must allow measuring trends over time against a well-established baseline and they should allow  integrated assessment across different scales134,143,165,167.  A  central  objective  of  sustainable  development  is  to  ensure  social  inclusion.  Metrics  should  go  beyond  reporting average  national indicators. Where  appropriate  and  feasible, metrics  should  be  disaggregated  according to gender, geography, socioeconomic status, disability, ethnicity, age, and other dimensions in  order to track and address marginalization and inequalities across sub-populations.   In practice, the choice among metrics involves trade-offs in terms of precision, scale, and cost165. It is thus  important to clarify the goals of measurement from the outset.  Irrespective  of  current  constraints,  an  overall  minimum  set  of  \"universal\"  indicators  is  needed.  These  should  be  consistent  metrics  that  provide  broad,  general  information  that  can  be  supplemented  with  others that are more tailored to regional or local applications or to specific questions167.   In order to avoid an oppressive list of indicators that might be inconsistent across time or space, it is also  important to identify proxies that can cover several of these information criteria.   Engaging the intended users in developing the right metrics and involving them in the data collection and  interpretation of results is likely to increase the chance for success.  An adaptive measurement strategy is needed to ensure that metrics and monitoring procedures evolve as  the  relevant  questions  for  sustainable  agricultural  intensification  change  over  time,  particularly  with  regard  to  ecological  and  environmental  questions167,168.  Enabling  conditions  should  be  created  for  stakeholders to advance the metrics.   Monitoring and modeling can play complementary roles.   Indicators should be few, with well tested methodology, guidelines and tools to be shared with countries  to  allow  them  to  develop  their  own  metrics  and  collect  data  on  their  own.  Efforts  should  be  made  to  support countries in taking ownership of those few SDG indicators at the ministerial and institutional level,  and assist them with adopting the best available data collection methods.   Metrics  should  make  use  of  already  available  international  and  national  data.  Significant  investments  should focus on improving local, national, and global data collection and processing, including using new  tools  (GIS,  remote  sensing,  social  networking,  mobile  phones,  crowd  sourcing,  etc.)  as  well  as  existing  ones.  Where  applicable,  on-farm  and  within-village  measurement  capability  should  be  created  using  information technology. As a result of the information revolution, the SDGs should be supported by online,  real-time,  place-based,  and  highly  disaggregated  data,  resulting  in  public  databases  for  monitoring  and  public participation.         47  At  present,  aggregate  data  and  models  are  widely  used  to  assess  the  current  status  and  make  projections  on  food  demand  and  supply,  agricultural  inputs,  poverty,  hunger  and  malnutrition.  Numerous uncertainties are inherent to this approach, both in terms of the quality of the available data  and  the  assumptions  used  in  projection  models.  Exaggerations  or  distortions  are  not  uncommon.  Detailed studies with complex conclusions are often turned into simplistic media messages rather than  more nuanced conclusions169. Moreover, many of the actual solutions will need to be implemented at  sub-national scales, all the way down to the household, farm, field and even within-field scales where  changes  in  behavior  as  well  as  precision  farming  technologies  will  be  a  critical  condition  for  success.  There is a need to create in each country a central register using baseline census data (population and  agriculture) and update these records regularly with data from many other sources, including surveys,  rapid  monitoring,  satellite  images  on  crop/area  cultivated,  yield,  etc.  The  national  household  survey  mechanism should still be supported, but simplified and made easy for respondents so as to get more  reliable  information  on  issues  not  captured  by  census  and  administrative  records.  International  organizations, such as the agencies, funds, and programs of the United Nations should support countries  in  improving  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  data  collection.  Where  official  development  assistance  is  required to finance improved data systems, these investments should be supported so that progress in  achieving  the  SDGs  can  be  monitored  in  real  time.  We  need  to  simplify  the  data  collection  methods  using simple questionnaires at different time periods. With the right technology, age census data can be  linked to a countrys administrative records so that each individual record is automatically updated, thus  avoiding time-consuming and expensive surveys.  Large uncertainties persist in terms of future population growth and structural transformations that are  likely to shift food consumption patterns by urban and rural consumers. Uncertainties also concern the  relative  roles  of  net  producers  and  net  consumers,  such  as  where  they  are  or  how  they  respond  to  agricultural  market  fluctuations.  Africa,  India  and  China  are  of  particular  importance  because  they  together  account  for  more  than  half  of  the  worlds  population  and  the  majority  of  the  worlds  food  insecure. We cannot tell for sure whether the worlds population will be 9 or 10 billion people by 2050,  but it is critical to know where additional people will be and what they will eat.  An additional 1 billion  people  has  huge  implications  for  additional  food  need,  but  it  can  also  result  in  the  loss  of  over  100  million hectares of agricultural land to urbanization. Data on consumption are often unreliable, and so  are data on postharvest losses and food waste. Existing estimates of key aspects of market behavior that  underpin existing economic models are often sparse and inconsistent. It is difficult to assess, understand  and project changes in consumer behavior because of large cultural and economic differences among  and within countries. Such information needs to be collected more regularly, primarily at the household  level and food chain scales.   On the food consumption side, what policymakers need are:   Cross-sectional information that includes comparisons between different social groups, regions   and net producers vs. net consumers  Information  on  long-term  trends,  patterns  of  seasonality  and  impact  of  production  shocks  on  food intake and incomes   Data on nutritional intake that include macro- and micro nutrients over time (both seasonal and  year-to-year) and space (within and between countries)  Available measures of FAO, the World Bank and other organizations on the number of people classified  as  living  in  extreme  poverty,  chronically  hungry  or  suffering  from  specific  nutritional  deficiencies  are  imperfect. There are poverty headcount maps for many countries. However, we generally do not have  spatial data on poverty gaps or hunger, and hunger data are not very reliable because they are often  food  balance  sheet  based134.  They  need  to  be  disaggregated  further,  to  sub-national  and  even  local  scales in rural and urban areas and they need to be updated regularly. Average or aggregate national  data that are 10 years old will not help with better targeting of policy decisions and investments to the  areas where they are most needed. The various agencies involved in the agriculture and health sectors  should  develop  common  and  internationally  comparable  dietary  quality  indicators  from  household   48  survey  data  (ideally  with  separate  indicators  for  children,  women  and  men).  Just  as  important  as  collecting better data is the development of a new generation of food system models for policymakers  that fully incorporate nutrition, environmental, and climate elements and their interactions.  On  the  supply  side  numerous  uncertainties  exist  about  the  general  quality  of  agricultural  and  other  statistics  in  many  countries,  including  data  on  crop  and  livestock  production,  fertilizer  use,  irrigation  water, labor, agrochemicals and many others. The available information on fertilizer and pesticide use  by crops, for example, is sparse in product detail and spatial resolution, not up to date, and generally not  verified  at  farm-scale.  Accurate  information  on  cropping  area,  crop  yields,  crop/livestock  damage  by  stresses  and  disasters,  climate  projections,  food  consumption,  trade,  ending  stocks,  non-food  uses  of  crops,  food  prices,  and  postharvest  losses  is  critical  for  improving  market  forecasts,  early  warning  systems and policy decisions. It is currently not available for many countries, delayed or only collected at  coarse  resolution  by  national  statistical  agencies  that  in  many  countries  lack  human  resources,  technology and operational funds. Instead, it must be spatially dense, transparent and timely, which will  also  require  using  new  remote  sensing  technology  and  forecasting  models.  Full  participation  by  all  information providers and analysts is essential, including those from the private sector. A collaborative  effort has recently been initiated to establish a new Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), but  it  is  currently  limited  to  the  G20  countries  and  few  non-G20  countries.  It  needs  to  be  substantially  improved  in  terms  of  spatial  resolution  and  coverage  as  well  as  quality  of  data.  Real-time,  high  resolution satellite imagery, particularly radar that penetrates clouds, can be of tremendous value for  improving  basic  crop  statistics,  for  making  crop  forecasts,  and  for  assessing  crop  damage.  The  technology  has  already  been  demonstrated  for  contrasting  regions,  including  commercial-scale  corn  farming in the USA170, assessing temporal changes in rice cropping in Nepal171, and real-time monitoring  of smallholder agriculture in Malawi172. It needs to become available to everyone, adapted for all of the  worlds major agricultural systems, and effectively utilized by national statistical agencies. Similar efforts  are  needed  to  improve  many  others  agricultural  statistics,  including  for  the  livestock  and  fisheries  sectors.  Uncertainties also exist about the potential and actual trajectories for agricultural land development and  the exploitable productivity gaps. Some progress has recently been made in disaggregating crop yields  and  yield  gaps  at  national  and  sub-national  levels92,173,  but  these  studies  have  still  relied  on  globally  available census data and other relatively coarse information. Promising new methodologies for more  standardized  yield  gap  analysis  have  recently  been  developed93,94,  which  will  allow  developing  a  new  Global Yield Gap Atlas (www.yieldgap.org).   Long-term  weather  and  soil  data  at  high  spatial  resolution  are  among  the  most  important  data  for  supporting SAI approaches, but they represent major data gaps in many countries. Given the concerns  about  climate  change  and  adaptation  to  it,  and  about  precision  management  in  relation  to  real-time  environmental  conditions,  this  should  be  among  the  highest  priorities  for  the  global  community  concerned with food security. All farmers and their advisors (and researchers) must have access to both  long-term weather data and real-time weather data at a high degree of spatial resolution.    More accurate, digital information on soils and nutrients is of particular importance, because it affects  decisions on fertilizer policies and management, crops that can be grown, land development strategies  and  investments,  land  rehabilitation  efforts,  and  many  other  things.  Progress  is  being  made  in  developing  digital  soil  information  systems  that  combine  legacy  data  with  new  remote  sensing  technology  and  fast  soil  analysis  methods,  and  thus  increase  the  spatial  resolution  and  quality  of  the  available information. New systems such as the Africa Soil Information Service (www.africasoils.net) will  fill major gaps and will allow customized products and services for diverse stakeholders to be developed.  However, they will require continuous, large R&D support and suitable business models for more self- 49  sustained operation, and they also need to spread to all major agricultural areas in the world. On the  other hand, no global nutrient monitoring system exists yet and the currently available data are highly  unreliable  for  many  countries  or  key  components  of  the  whole  nutrient  chain.  Such  information  is  critical for guiding policies as well as for tailoring nutrient management and stewardship programs so  that they can achieve productivity, efficiency, social and environmental targets.   With current data and modeling, climate data cannot easily be extrapolated to provide conclusive local  recommendations174.  Therefore,  a  more  precise  agriculture  will  also  require  long-term  and  real-time  weather information for all major crop-producing regions, with fine spatial resolution. We also need to  know  more  about  the  adoption  of  new  technologies,  and  about  which  areas  currently  used  for  production of staple food crops are in a spiral of land degradation. We need to build a whole new global  system for monitoring the performance of agriculture at a fine scale143 (see Chapter 4.2.) and reward  farmers who make steady progress towards improving their metrics. Our ultimate ambition should be to  monitor  through  various  means  nearly  every  hectare  of  existing  farmland  within  the  next  10  years.  Complete  coverage  of  all  farmland  will  only  be  possible  through  use  of  new  digital  technologies,  including  mobile  phone  platforms  for  bottom-up  collection  of  farm  and  farmer  information.  A  global  effort is needed to design, test, and scale the necessary data platforms, analytical and implementation  tools, and train human resources in both the public and private sector on how to use digital technologies  in agriculture.   Strengthening  data  collection  capacity  at  the  national  level  is  of  high  priority,  but  it  also  needs  to  be  extended to the local government level. The situation has become even more complex in recent years as  a  result  of  the  resurging  interest  in  statistics  on  agriculture  and  food  systems,  with  many  more  organizations collecting their own data in an uncoordinated, non-integrated manner. Governments and  international organizations such as UN organizations, the World Bank, regional development banks, and  International  Agricultural  Research  Centers  have  a  long  history  of  collecting  data,  but  without  proper  integration of their data systems. In addition, more and more private companies and foundations as well  as many NGOs are collecting data through in-house units, projects or outsourcing to third parties. By  and large, it is reasonable to assume that many of the real or perceived data gaps could already be filled  if  ways  could  be  found  to  better  align  these  efforts,  harmonize  methodologies  and  share  data.  New  strategies will be needed for sourcing, analyzing and sharing vast quantities of data.   Immediate steps that need to be taken to support this process start with the commitment of all partners  to  support  the  open  sharing  of  data  and  learning  in  real-time  to  support  rapid-cycle  agricultural  innovation. The G8 leaders have recently signed an Open Data Charterv, which should be embraced by  all  countries  and  thus  also  become  a  key  measure  for  supporting  agricultural  development.  Governments  and  institutions  will  need  to  translate  this  into  policies  and  incentives  that  ensure  the  timely release of important data so that new insights can be extracted to further accelerate agricultural  development and also support cross-sector exchange with health, environment and finance, all of which  affect  the  lives  of  the  rural  poor.  A  new  paradigm  is  needed  to  reward  public  as  well  as  private  organizations  who  share  research  data  with  the  broader  community  while  acknowledging  and  appreciating their intellectual contribution. This is a complex challenge to face over the next 3-5 years  but  it  is  one  we  must  collectively  own  and  implement  if  we  are  to  realize  the  vision  of  sustainable  agriculture. We hope that soon there will be a coordinated global network of measurement activities  that includes critical biophysical, socioeconomic, and nutritional metrics.                                                               v The G8 Open Data Charter, signed June 2013, is available at  www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207772/Open_Data_Charter.pdf.   50  Other useful tools can be deployed to analyze trends and inform the public, policy makers, and other  actors  for  making  the  right  decisions.  Many  useful  composite  indices  or  decision  and  communication  tools have been proposed in recent years to score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems  (Annex  3).  Composite  indices  and  user-friendly  decision  tools  cannot  replace  the  specific  indicators  needed to measure progress towards achieving targets and SDGs, but they can be valuable additional  tools for policy guidance and decision-making, communication, education and concrete action. They are  particularly  valuable  for  engaging  stakeholders  at  different  levels  and  scales,  including  at  local  level,  along the whole value chain and support system.    51  4. Solutions available for action 4.1. Context-specific solutions that transcend small- to large-scale farming and food systems  Farming  systems  are  complex  and  highly  heterogeneous  at  all  scales,  from  regional  and  national  to  village  or  farm.  So  too  are  farming  objectives,  solutions  and  tradeoffs175,176.  Strategies  for  SAI  must  provide viable options for farms that can produce substantial surpluses as wells as for those small farms  that support the livelihood of millions of rural people. The specific policies and technology solutions for  implementing SAI largely depend on the socioeconomic and biophysical contexts under which farmers  currently operate, with resource endowment and market access being two main drivers across different  scales  (Fig.  4-1).  Many  other  factors  diversify  households  (size,  social  status,  religion/tribe/caste,  education, etc.), but many of these are also linked to resource endowment and market access. Different  solutions are required for large farms with good market access and high input use (4), small farms with  good market access and high input use (3), small farms with weak market access and low input use (2) or  larger farms with poor market access (1).    Figure 4-1. Resource endowment and access to markets are key determinants for tailoring different  solutions to the local context to overcome current constraints and establish better business models  for agriculture.    The  real  new  challenge  is  to  move  to  better  business  models  by  choice,  beyond  thousands  of  poor  smallholders  by  default.  At  the  core  of  devising  solutions  lies  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  socioeconomic  and  biophysical  factors  that  drive  the  needs  of  farmers,  agri-businesses,  small  entrepreneurs, consumers, and many other actors. We need to characterize and segment the \"market\"  in order to target technologies and policies, and then \"market\" better technologies efficiently  through  modern delivery systems. Countries need to move away from subjective mapping of factors of theorized  importance to a rigorous definition of development and business domains based on quantitative data  for resource endowment and market access177. Solutions need to be flexible in terms of offering a suite  of  technologies  and  support  systems  provided  by  different  sectors  in  a  complementary  mode,  with  a  particular emphasis on business-driven models.   Different  paradigms  are  required  for  different  regions  (Box  4-1).  Farmers  who  are  blessed  with  large  landholdings and other capital, good market access and support systems, and the capacity to use farm  inputs  like  irrigation,  purchased  fertilizer  and  other  agricultural  inputs  can  produce  the  large  surplus   52  yields  that  keep  food  prices  low.  Such  farmers,  like  their  counterparts  with  smaller  farms,  may  be  vulnerable to rising energy costs insofar as irrigation, fertilizer and transport to market are dependent  on fossil fuels. Technologies that allow them to increase yields and the efficiency of cost-intensive inputs  (or substitute them partially) will increase their profitability and reduce the potential damage done to  the environment.  Box 4-1. The paradigm of SAI in African smallholder agriculture96  Food  production  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  is  not  keeping  pace  with  food  demand.  Yield  gaps  are  large  and  pervasive  in  African  smallholder  agriculture  for  almost  all  crops  in  all  regions.  At  present,  most  smallholder  farmers  are  unable  to  benefit  from  potential  yield  gains  offered  by  plant  genetic  improvement.  Challenges  faced include lack of access to water, nutrients, quality seeds  and other inputs, small landholdings, poor soil  quality and lack of capital to invest in improving soils. Coupled with intense labor demands caused by lack of  mechanization,  timely  and  better-quality  field  management  is  impeded.  Irrigation,  mechanization  and  local  seed production of crops that have economical value for farmers are among the key improvements needed for  increasing  agricultural  production  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  but  they  need  to  go  hand  in  hand  with  better  agronomy.  Continued  cropping  without  sufficient  addition  of  nutrients  and  organic  matter  leads  to  soil  degradation, rendering many soils non-responsive to seeds, fertilizers and other inputs. This lack of response  constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many small farmers in Africa. Given the poor agricultural productivity of  only 1 t/ha of cereal grain across much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary goal is to increase crop productivity  per unit of  resource invested, through carefully targeted interventions across scales. Little  can be gained by  trying to raise the genetic yield potential when current yields are 20% or less of what is achievable. But much  can be gained by improving the genetic adaptation to local stress complexes and combining these traits with  those  preferred  by farmers  and  consumers.  An important  fraction  of  the  yield  gap  can  be  reduced  through  better agronomy (irrigation, planting dates, spacing, cultivars, early weeding, etc.) even when only microdoses  of fertilizers can be applied. Sound agronomic management is a prerequisite for efficient use of quality seeds,  irrigation,  and  nutrients.  Many  African  smallholder  farmers  already  practice  their  own  forms  of  precision  farming  by  recognizing  soil  fertility  gradients  in  their  farms  and  fields  and  allocating  crops  and  resources  differently. This knowledge, combined with scientific knowledge, simple diagnostic tools such as soil test kits or  leaf  color  charts,  and  solid  policy  support  can  form  the  basis  for  a  broader  SAI  framework  and  its  local  adaptation and implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa. It needs to focus on targeted best fit approaches from  a portfolio of options rather than pushing best-bet or silver-bullet approaches.      On the other hand, globally, there are over 500 million small family farmsw, most of which are mixed  farms  producing  crops  and  livestock178.  Half  of  the  worlds  cereals  are  produced  in  these  small-scale  mixed  farms.  Smallholder  farmers  are  often  at  a  disadvantage  in  terms  of  available  resources  and  accessing markets. They rely substantially on self-provisioning. It is difficult for a farming family to make  a better living from growing crops or raising a few animals on a half-hectare plot with few inputs and  unsophisticated technologies, unable to reach the market. Not all small-scale farmers can become large- scale farmers, but some form of aggregation of primary production and support services will be required  in order to take advantage of new markets and technologies, and to transform farming into an attractive  local business and job opportunity. In many developing and emerging economies where youth make up  20%  of  the  population  and  youth  and  womens  unemployment  is  a  serious  issue,  new  visions  of  smallholder farming with enhanced societal value and respect would provide a deliberate platform for  generating employment opportunities and reducing migration from rural areas to urban centers.  All farmers need to be moved towards good access to inputs, markets, information and other supporting  services (Fig. 4-1). Strategies that provide the needed support base as well as timely market information                                                               w Farms two hectares or less in size. This includes some 280 million small farms in India and China alone.  53  would lower the barriers for participating in domestic and export markets. Such mechanisms include: (i)  formation  of  cooperatives  or  growers  associations  to  increase  their  collective  ability  for  effective  negotiation,  sharing  of  the  cost  of  inputs,  more  efficient  dissemination  of  new  ideas  and  market  information to farmers, and reduction of cost of certification; (ii) participation in outgrower schemes  organized by centralized agribusinesses where the smallholder provides land and labor in exchange for  technical assistance, credit, inputs, infrastructural support and market knowledge; (iii) access to high- value  crop  options,  niche  markets  and  the  necessary  information  and  technologies  for  successful  production; and (iv) regional initiatives which help to disseminate technologies, increase smallholders  market leverage and coordinate reliable supplies.   Governments, civil society, the private sector and international agencies must work together with local  extension services and farmers to support the tailoring of SAI solutions to farmers needs by improving:   Diagnosis:  Understand  the  context  in  which  an  effort  or  an  intervention  will  be  implemented  and its links to the best available scientific and local knowledge.   Contextualized  principles:  Identify  the  right  economic,  social  and  ecological  principles  of  relevance to farmers needs.    Getting it right locally: Empower local communities to improve the performance of the farming  system or value chain based on scientific principles and local preferences.  Scaling  and  support:  Expand  the  scope  of  the  effort  or  intervention  (in  terms  of  numbers  of  people involved and the size of the territory) and create the necessary value chains, services,  support systems and self-sustained business models.   Evidence: Monitor and document the performance, and learn to enrich the local, national and  global knowledge base to influence policies that will support further implementation.  4.2. Solutions for early action  Practical solutions for transforming world agriculture need to address innovation, markets, people, and  political  leadership68.  Solutions  need  to  enable  concrete  action  for  change,  towards  meeting  one  or  more of the targets defined in Chapter 3. Sharp focus must remain on solutions for poverty reduction  and improving the livelihoods of rural households and communities, including more resilient crop and  livestock systems that can stand extreme heat, drought, floods and other climatic extremes. Small-scale  food production offers a direct route to ending hunger and malnutrition and reducing poverty, but small  producers    especially  if  incentivized  by  having  land  tenure    are  also  an  army  of  potential  environmental  stewards  that  can  help  protect  natural  resources  and  ecosystem  services  better  than  governments or large companies127. Small farmers, service providers, processors, marketers and other  local  entrepreneurs  must  be  central  to  any  investment  and  policy  strategy  that  enables  the  development and widespread adoption of new solutions67,73.   Equal  weight  needs  to  be  given  to  interventions  at  the  farm  level  and  solutions  for  improving  post- harvest food chains, all the way to the consumer. New opportunities exist for solutions that combine  food  industry  and  agribusiness  development  with  the  food  security,  poverty  alleviation,  and  environmental agenda. The domestic private sector  composed of millions of farmers and other local  businesses  is by far the biggest investor in agriculture179. Goals for sustainable agriculture and food  production can only be achieved if domestic governments and the international community create an  enabling  environment  that  enhances  sustainable  and  inclusive  private  investment  in  agriculture.  This  also requires full participation by the business community in international, national and local platforms  that aim to implement the new sustainable development agenda. For small farmers to be able to step  up to a higher level, key challenges to overcome include securing control over land, water and other  critical resources, and gaining access to better infrastructure, inputs, knowledge and markets.    54  Early  solutions  need  to  focus  on  critical  areas  where  improvements  in  crop,  livestock  and  fish  productivity  and  environmental  performance  can  be  made  relatively  quickly.  Although  crop92  and  livestock45 productivity gaps vary greatly worldwide, they are particularly large in Sub-Saharan Africa180,  South Asia and some other developing regions. In many of these countries or regions within countries  significant  gains  in  productivity  and  resource  efficiency  are  possible  through  better  seeds,  irrigation,  nutrient  management,  and  other  agronomic  measures.  Policy  measures  have  a  huge  impact  on  the  success of such early actions. For example, instead of flat subsidies that encourage inefficient water use  or  groundwater  depletion,  variable  policy  tools  could  include  better  measurement  of  water  consumption,  variable  pricing  of  electricity  for  irrigation,  cross-subsidizing  small  holders  with  revenue  from large holders, or targeted support for new technologies that result in higher water use efficiency  without a reduction in crop yields181.  On  the  other  hand,  opportunities  for  improving  the  environmental  performance  of  agriculture  are  largest in countries such as China, where input use is already high and often inefficient, particularly with  regard  to  water,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  and  energy182.  People  are  the  primary  agents  of  change.  They  must be at the center of solutions for concrete action at national to local scales. On one hand we need  to  strive  to  change  the  behavior  of  everyone,  from  the  food  producer  to  the  consumer,  including  politicians  and  business  executives.  On  the  other  hand,  we  need  to  provide  new  opportunities  for  people - women and youth in particular - to become part of a new sustainable development movement  through  attractive  job  opportunities.  That  requires  equipping  people  with  the  knowledge,  skills,  new  tools and information needed to enact change.     An important way to solve problems is through practical initiatives involving new technologies, business  models, institutional mechanisms, and/or policies that are promising for early action, can take place in  any country, and can also generate learning elsewhere. They need to address various components of SAI  and its enabling systems (Fig. 2-1), but many are connected and must be integral parts of a systematic  approach  to  SAI,  from  food  production  to  consumption  (Box  4-2).  Many  solutions  will  have  to  be  integrated  initiatives  designed  and  implemented  in  a  specific  development  or  landscape  context,  in  response to the most relevant national and local challenge domains for agriculture. Nevertheless, we  should also recognize those few interventions or innovations that could indeed trigger transformative  changes in farming or a whole food chain over a relatively short period.  Below  we  provide  examples  of  solutions  for  early-action,  i.e.,  interventions  that  could  be  of  high  priority  for  many  countries  in  the  coming  5  to  15  years.  We  do  not  aim  to  provide  simple  recipes  or  policy strategies with specific priorities for countries or regions. Instead, our examples are a basket of  options for countries to consider and adapt to their specific needs. They can be further prioritized and  customized  based  on  cross-sectoral  benefits,  scalability  and  wide  applicability,  novelty,  feasibility,  learning  by  doing,  comprehensive  vetting  and  sponsorship.  Countries  need  to  be  committed  to  implement  these  solutions  themselves,  but  with  support  as  required  from  other  countries  and  international  agencies.  Technology  spillover  and  many  forms  of  between,  cross-country  and  cross- regional  learning  should  play  a  major  role  in  guiding  countries  and  helping  them  to  move  faster.  International  action  networks  such  as  the  SDSN  will  promote  selected  solutions  initiatives  for  early- stage demonstration, development and scaling up.    55  Box 4-2. Ten key actions for improving nutrient use efficiency in food systems  Improving  the  full-chain  Nutrient  Use  Efficiency  (NUE)  of  nitrogen  and  phosphorus,  defined  as  the  ratio  of  nutrients in final products to new nutrient inputs, is a central element in meeting the challenge to produce  more food  and  energy with less  pollution  and  better  use  of available  nutrient resources. Nutrient  flow is  a  cycle from resources through stages of use (blue arrows) and recycling (green arrows). The system is driven by  the motors of human consumption (red), which are thus also a key part of the solutions needed for achieving  future nutrient targets. The poorest need to be allowed to increase their food and other nutrient consumption,  while  the  richest  must  realize  that  it  is  not  in  their  own  interest  to  over  consume.  There  are  significant  differences in the cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus or other nutrients among and within countries that need to  be taken into account in determining specific targets and interventions. Hence, the targets for nutrient use and  NUE will vary among countries and so will the pathways for achieving them by addressing any of the specific  components  of  the  full-chain  NUE  relative  to  their  current  state.  Possible  actions  include  (numbers  in  the  graph):  1  Improve  NUE  in  crop  production;  2  Improve  NUE  in  animal  production;  3  Increase  the  fertilizer  equivalence value of animal manure; 4 Low-emission combustion and energy-efficient systems; 5 Develop NOX  capture  and  utilization  technology;  6  Improve  efficiency  in  the  fertilizer  and  food  supply  and  reduce  food  waste;  7  Recycle  N  and  P  from  waste  water  systems;  8  Energy  and  transport  saving;  9  Lower  personal  consumption of animal protein; and 10 Spatial and temporal optimization of nutrient flows. Of the 10 solutions  proposed,  the  first  three  are  directly  related  to  agricultural  systems  management.  Specific  targets  and  indicators can be defined for each of these steps.  (Center for Ecology and Hydrology, Global Partnership on Nutrient Management, INI, Edinburgh, 2012).  Source: Fig. 6.1., Sutton, M.A. et al. Our nutrient world: the challenge to produce more food and energy with less pollution.    56   New, productive crop varieties for the poor  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 6b, 9a  Crop yield growth rates in many smallholder farms remain too low and farmers often experience periods  of  food  or  income  insecurity  due  to  yield  losses  caused  by  abiotic  and  biotic  stresses.  Every  farmer  should  have  access  to  affordable,  quality  seed  from  a  wide  range  of  well-adapted  crop  varieties  or  hybrids through government, private sector and community seed systems. Enhanced breeding methods  such as marker-assisted precision breeding or genetic engineeringx can be deployed to speed up the rate  of  genetic  gain,  shorten  the  time  it  takes  to  develop  new  varieties,  and  breed  new  varieties  more  precisely  for  specific  environments  and  market  segments,  thus  better  meeting  farmers'  needs99,100,109.  This requires investments to transform public and private sector breeding pipelines of major food crops  into  faster,  more  efficient,  product-oriented  breeding  pipelines.  Full  advantage  can  now  be  taken  of  wider  genetic  diversity,  genome  sequence  information,  genome-wide  molecular  markers,  low-cost  genotyping platforms, rapid generation advancement, breeding population development technologies,  better phenotyping and variety testing methods, and breeding information management tools.   Box 4-3. Stress-tolerant rice varieties as a climate-smart solution for the poor  The  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI)  and  its  national  partners  in  Asia  are  developing  a  new  generation  of  rice  varieties  that  are  tolerant  to  submergence,  drought,  heat,  salinity  and  combinations  of  those.  In  the  early  1990s,  using  a  flood-tolerant  landrace  from  Eastern  India,  scientists  at  IRRI  and  the  University of California-Davis discovered a major locus on chromosome 9 of the rice genome  later called the  SUB1 gene  that allows rice to endure complete submergence for up to 2 weeks, thus greatly reducing the risk  of flood damage, which threatens 20 million hectares of lowland areas in Asia. Subsequent fine mapping of the  gene and progress in DNA marker technology enabled marker-assisted breeding of high-yielding rice varieties  with flood tolerance and yield advantages of 13 t/ha demonstrated in farmers fields. The first new variety,  Swarna-Sub1, was developed in 2006, followed by official release in 2009. Quality seed was rapidly multiplied  and disseminated through a large network of over 400 hundred public, civil society and private sector partners  in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, supported by national policy makers and international donors. By 2013, about  4 million rice farmers in these three countries grew the new flood-tolerant rice183. Similar approaches are being  applied to breeding drought-tolerant rice, showing consistently large yield advantages of 0.5-1.5 t/ha99. New  breeding  products  combine  drought  with  submergence  tolerance,  heat  with  drought  tolerance,  or  submergence with salt tolerance through marker-assisted selection, which will provide \"free\" crop insurance  for farmers184.    Intellectual  property  regimes  and  national  variety  release  guidelines  need  to  be  modernized,  harmonized and incentivized to rapidly release new varieties and encourage investment in breeding and  seed businesses. Seed laws and policies need to enable and support a vibrant public and private seed  system, including many small- and medium-size companies and seed producer groups. Well-coordinated  global  crop  improvement  networks  can  further  accelerate  progress  in  genetic  gain  by  increasing  the  resolution and precision of environmental information, working across key domains and hotspots for a  range  of  biotic,  abiotic,  and  socio-economic  constraints,  and  sharing  knowledge,  genetic  and  other  resources  in  'open  source'  breeding  platforms185.  Countries  with  insufficient  breeding  capacity  would  gain from progress being made in other countries, thus enabling farmers worldwide to increase yields  and reduce the risk of yield losses due to drought, high temperatures, flooding, salinity, diseases and                                                               x Marker-assisted selection is a conventional breeding method in which the selection process is accelerated by detecting the  presence of desired traits (DNA sequences) through molecular markers or whole-genome analysis. In contrast, genetic  modification (GM) involves the direct transfer of genes from one organism to another, including genes from other species.     57  insect pests. Among the most successful examples so far has been the development and deployment of  a new generation of stress-tolerant varieties for rainfed lowland rice areas in Asia and Africa (Box 4-3).  More nutritious staple food crops  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 5c  A few staple food crops dominate the food intake of 2 billion people suffering from undernourishment  caused  by  iron,  zinc,  vitamin  A  and  other  deficiencies.  Achieving  better  nutritional  balance  involves  a  wide  range  of  measures,  diversification  of  agricultural  systems  (crops,  livestock  and  fish  products),  external mineral and vitamin supply, optimal feeding and caring practices, breeding of more nutritious  crops, agronomic biofortification, and other measures186. Supplementation programs or the promotion  of home gardens or livestock and fish have limits in terms of reaching all of the poor; many do not even  have the land or other resources to grow their own more nutritious food. While the health benefits of a  balanced  diet  are  clear,  biofortification    the  enrichment  of  staple  food  crops  with  micronutrients,  vitamin  A  or  other  enhanced  nutritional  traits  through  breeding  or  fertilizers    is  another  effective  strategy for overcoming specific nutritional deficiencies in rural populations in developing countries. It  reaches  down  to  the  lowest  income  levels  and  elevates  the  base  level  of  nutrient  intake,  thus  also  making  many  other  interventions  more  successful,  and  helping  to  eradicate  hidden  hunger  by  2030.  Even small increases in the protein, mineral, or vitamin content of staple crops can make a significant  difference  in  nutrition  and  health.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  recent  years  to  breed  more  nutritious  food  crops,  through  both  conventional  breeding  and  genetic  modification  (GM).  Promising  examples include vitamin A-enriched sweet potatoes (orange sweet potato), rice (Golden Rice), maize  and cassava; high-zinc rice and wheat; and high-iron beans, pearl millet and rice. Several conventional  varieties  have  already  been  released  and  the  results  of  efficacy  and  effectiveness  studies  have  confirmed  substantial  nutrition  benefits187.  Countries,  civil  society  and  international  agencies  should  take measures to accelerate progress in breeding, release and distribution of biofortified crop varieties.  Breeding  programs  need  to  include  nutrition  traits  in  their  standard  product  profiles  and  variety  evaluation  schemes  so  that  nutrition  traits  become  part  of  mainstream  breeding.  This  is  a  departure  from the past focus on long shelf life, standard color and shape which is often achieved at the expense  of nutritional content as there is often a trade-off between the various traits. Breeders need to take full  advantage  of  new  genomics,  biotechnology  and  breeding  technologies  to  achieve  quantum  leaps  in  micronutrient and vitamin enrichment of food crops targeting the poor. Deployment of these varieties  through  local  seed  systems  needs  to  be  accelerated  to  ensure  that  quality  seed  is  available  and  affordable.  In  addition  to  breeding,  micronutrient  fertilization  is  another  highly  successful  strategy  to  fortify  crops  agronomically.  By  adding,  zinc,  selenium  or  iodine  to  conventional  fertilizer  blends,  it  is  possible  to  not  only  boost  productivity  through  yield  gains  but  also  to  eradicate  deficiencies  in  humans188.  New models for agricultural extension  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 6b, 8b, 9a  Many unexploited income, productivity and resource efficiency gaps can be closed through accelerating  the  transfer  of  new  knowledge  and  technologies,  enhancing  access  by  farmers  to  markets  and  information,  facilitating  better  interaction  among  farmers  and  knowledge  providers,  and  assisting  farmers and small businesses to develop their own technical, organizational and management skills and  practices.  This  is  the  essence  of  good  agricultural  extension  and  it  has  been  the  driving  force  for  productivity enhancements in many developed countries53. In crop production, for example, it requires  systematically implementing programs aimed at improving farmers skills in practices such as cropping  systems choice, land preparation, choosing the right seed, planting, water and nutrient management,   58  control of pests, diseases, and weeds, machine operation, harvest and postharvest operations, record  keeping, farm business management, and information technology. Throughout the world,  every farmer  should  have  access  to  good-quality  extension  and  advisory  services  provided  by  the  public  sector,  private companies or consultants, NGOs, or farmer organizations. All of them can play complementary  roles.  Unfortunately,  agricultural  extension  systems  in  most  low-  and  medium-income  countries  are  weak, both in term of outreach capacity and the quality of service provided. They often lack incentive  schemes  and  mechanisms for professional training  for agricultural advisory workers. Different sectors  rarely work together.   Demand-driven,  pluralistic  advisory  and  extension  systems  with  motivated,  skilled  professionals  and  effective use of modern information-communication technologies (ICT) will be required for making SAI a  reality, in every farm189. Depending on the most appropriate local extension model, professional crop  advisers, government extension agents, farmer facilitators, community knowledge workers, as well as  sellers of agricultural inputs need to become trusted expert contacts for farmers. A new generation of  agricultural  knowledge  workers  must  have  the  necessary  technical,  interpersonal  and  communication  skills,  professional  certification  and  continued  education,  means  of  transport,  technical  backstopping,  and  more.  They  also  need  to  have  clear  incentives  to  help  farmers  succeed53.  To  both  generate  new  knowledge  and  provide  local  agriculture  solutions  for  farmers  they  need  to  have  strong  links  to  and  understanding  of  adaptive  research  within  relevant  agro-ecologies.  They  also  need  to  be  in  full  command of soft facilitation skills, modern decision tools, and information technologies (mobile/smart  phones, internet, social media, participatory video, remote sensing, soil and weather data, etc.)  Realizing  this  vision  will  require  transformative  institutional  changes  of  current  agricultural  extension  systems  in  most  countries,  including  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector,  as  well  as  complementary  changes  in  agricultural  research,  especially  greater  capacity  in  adaptive  research  linked  to  extension  capacity189. Many new models are currently being piloted. First lessons are being compiled by global and  regional  platforms  for  rural  advisory  systems  such  as  MEAS  (www.meas-extension.org/meas- offers/case-studies)190 or GFRAS (www.g-fras.org/en). Innovations include demand-driven and market- oriented mechanisms to link farmers more directly to improved technology, new business models and  product  markets,  such  as  the  China  Agriculture  Extension  Special  Task  Force  or  FIPS-Africa  (http://fipsafrica.org),  in  which  self-employed  village-based  advisors  also  participate  in  profit-sharing  schemes  with  farmers.  Following  a  multi-technology  approach,  such  practitioners  must  have  good  command  of  both  technical  and  entrepreneurial  skills.  There  is  also  significant  potential  for  linking  agricultural  extension  with  other  sectors,  for  example  nutrition  and  health,  education,  finance,  and  government  services.  The  key  to  success  will  be  to  create  scalable,  self-sustained  business  models  in  which a new generation of proud and skilled agriculture professionals can earn a good living by serving  farmers, entrepreneurs and others involved in agricultural value chains.  Nutrient management and stewardship  from science to local solutions  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 6b, 8b, 9a  Improving  nutrient  management  is  a  central  element  in  meeting  the  challenge  to  increase  food  production, increase farm incomes, improve soil quality, reduce nutrient losses to the environment and  protect natural ecosystems. Both governments and businesses play an important role in this process.  Science-based  principles  for  integrated,  site-specific  use  of  fertilizers,  organic  materials  and  other  nutrient  sources  have  been  developed  through  research.  Site-specific  nutrient  management  in  crops  such as rice, wheat and maize has shown large benefits in terms of yield, farm profit, increased nitrogen  use  efficiency  and  better  nutrient  balances191-193.  Mobile  phone  and  web  applications  have  been  developed  in  many  countries,  e.g.  NM  Rice  (www.irri.org/nmrice). Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) strategies that make use of mineral  for  use  by  extension  workers  and  farmers  59  fertilizers and locally available organic amendments but also promote other good management practices  are  a  key  to  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  improving  poor  soils  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa176,194.  Countries,  businesses  and  international  donors  should  invest  in  solutions  initiatives  that  seek  to  systematically  increased  crop  production,  sustainability  and  associated benefits, such as the 4R Nutrient Stewardship programs (Box 4-4).  improve  nutrient  management  for  crop  yield,  profitability  and  environmental  performance.  4R  Nutrient  implementation  of  regionally  specific  best  management  practices.  Box 4-4. 4R Nutrient Stewardship  Enhanced  nutrient  stewardship  plays a critical role  in  increasing  crop production  and sustainability.  It  is the  foundation  for  improving  farm  incomes,  and  in  turn,  improving  food  and  nutritional  security,  education,  healthcare,  local  employment  and  environmental  investments.  In  cases  of  low  nutrient  use  efficiency  and  higher  crop  production  it  supports  grower  efforts  to  increase  crop  uptake  of  nutrients  while  continuing  to  increase  Stewardship  (www.nutrientstewardship.com)  provides  an  action  framework  for  improving  the  economic,  social  and  environmental performance of nutrient use. Applying the right source of plant nutrients at the right rate, time,  and place within a cropping system is the basis for nutrient stewardship. These four rights are necessary for  sustainable  management  of  plant  nutrients  using  both  organic  and  inorganic  amendments,  and  when  used  with other agronomic best management practices (e.g., improved seed, planting density, etc.), allow growers  to achieve economic,  social  and environmental goals195. Performance  improvement goals  are specific  to the  region (increased yield, improved nutrient use efficiency, reduced runoff and leaching, etc.) and are achieved  through  involves  participatory learning through continuous  assessment  of  impacts, and feedback  from researchers, extension  workers and growers in a process of iterative enhancements. Improving nutrient use among farmers supports  local  and  regional  activities  on  improving  environmental  goods  and  services  such  as  water  quality,  but  also  strengthens  local  agri-businesses  that  provide  inputs,  dispense  agronomic  advice  and  support  the  local  economy.  Model  sites  are  being  established  in  North  America  within  key  watersheds  to  advance  nutrient  stewardship programming and a research fund has been established to advance the system. In Kenya, a model  site has been established to create a 4R nutrient stewardship system and enabling extension for small maize  producers.  The  system  will  be  implemented  in  pilot  areas  with  the  goal  of  increasing  yields,  improving  soil  quality and supporting the development of agribusiness. An iterative implementation and scaling model will be  used  to  customize  the  solution  to  regional  and  local  needs  using  model  sites.  All  information  will  be  open  source,  allowing  interested  stakeholders  to  adopt  and  adapt  the  solution to  their  local  situation.  Additional  private  and  public  partners  are  being  sought  to  expand  pilot  sites,  extension  staffing  and  expert  farmer  programming, but also scale up to include new crops, other best management practices, and the use of digital  technologies to support local adoption and the sharing of information globally.   Implementation   Micro-irrigation for smallholder farmers  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 6c  Many  smallholder  farms  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  Asia,  and  other  regions  are  trapped  in  poverty  and  experience periods of food insecurity due to low cropping intensity and productivity caused by water  stress. Irrigation is a key entry point for doubling or tripling crop yields and enabling diversification of  cropping  systems.  Large-scale  irrigation  systems  are  capital  intensive  and  restricted  to  lowland  areas  with suitable conditions. Solar-powered drip or other micro-irrigation technologies, on the other hand,  can be customized to meet the needs of small farmers operating in diverse environments with limited  capital. Micro-irrigation systems precisely deliver water, nutrients and other inputs directly to the root  zone, resulting in high yields and high efficiency of these inputs. Equipped with additional filters, these  systems can also supply clean drinking water. Smart-metered, local solar and wind power utility models  can provide the electricity needed for irrigation pumps, as well as local households, schools, and small  village  enterprises,  including  processing  or  storing  of  food.  Demonstrated  impacts  include  improved   60  food security and nutrition, increased incomes, reduced poverty, and new local business opportunities  and jobs196,197.  Modern low-pressure drip or other micro-irrigation systems are modular and can be designed to meet  varying local needs, ranging from a small family plot to village or community-scale production. A stage- wise  introduction  and  scaling  up  strategy  includes  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  biophysical  and  socioeconomic  environment  for  technology  design  and  business  model  development,  financing,  business  development,  training  of  farmers  and  professionals,  and  linkages  to  input  suppliers  and  markets. Solutions for harvesting rainwater or accessing and storing available surface and groundwater  water need to be adapted to the local situation. Young agricultural professionals and technicians need  to be trained and have the right incentives to provide professional services to farmers as a business. To  minimize  risk  and  enhance  food  security,  drip-irrigated,  intensified  cropping  systems  should  include  staple food crops and crops with high nutritional and market value (e.g., vegetables, fruits). Intensive,  diverse, all-year-round cropping is scheduled by the local community according to water and electricity  needs by different crops and users. Farmers may also form new cooperatives or other small enterprises  through which drip irrigation agriculture is done. Contract farming can become an integral part of such  new value chains. Services, maintenance and inputs are provided by local utility and service company  professionals,  supported  by  public  sector  research  and  extension  workers.  Local  workshops  for  small  machinery,  pumps,  repair  and  maintenance  can  create  additional  jobs.  Implementation  requires  low- interest capital from various sources as well as financing through pay-per use models for both electricity  and  water.  Smartphones  linked  to  the  internet  provide  access  to  real-time  weather  and  market  information  and  are  also  used  for  real-time  water  and  electricity  monitoring,  and  customer  management (contract tracking, billing, and payments).  Investing in livestock markets  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 5c, 6a  Livestock account for 40% of agricultural GDP in developing countries and four of the five highest traded  agricultural  commodities  are  livestock  products,  but  the  sector  underperforms  in  terms  of  its  contribution to food security, poverty reduction and livelihoods of smallholder producers. By investing  now in the promotion of livestock enterprises and value chain development, national governments and  the donor community could pave the way for the emergence of a livestock industry that will sustainably  respond  to  national  food  security  needs  while  staying  inclusive  of  small  livestock  keepers.  National  livestock  strategies  promoting  enterprise  and  value  chain  development  should  address  four  main  constraints198,199:  1)  Strengthening  the  institutions  governing  livestock  product  value  chains:  Foster  the  emergence  of  livestock  commodity  associations  where  representatives  from  all  the  stakeholders  in  particular  commodity chains sit together to resolve common problems for the whole chain. The South African Red  Meat Industry Forum is a successful example of this.   2)  Consolidating  the  enabling  environment  for  livestock  businesses:  This  includes  a)  developing  and  enforcing  a  legal  framework  for  livestock  sector  businesses,  b)  development  of  appropriate  road,  electricity,  water,  information  and  communication  technologies  and  slaughtering  and  market  infrastructures,  c)  facilitation  of  international  trade  by,  for  example  promoting  itinerant  customs  controls  across  the  country  rather  than  only  at  ports  of  entry  and  aligning  trade  regulations  across  countries, d) strengthening animal health systems and e) setting up livestock product quality and safety  standards which are adapted to the countrys situation and its smallholder farmers and which are also  trustworthy for regional foreign buyers.  61  3) Implementing targeted public incentives to encourage investment in livestock enterprises: Establish a  government  investment  fund  targeting  the  livestock  sector  and  which  can  contribute  to  funding  investment activities by farmers, SMEs and larger agro-industries and to help secure loans from private  banks or microfinance institutions.   4)  Developing  the  business  management  capacities  of  livestock  value  chain  stakeholders:  Livestock  sector  development  will  not  happen  without  capacity  building  of  smallholder  farmers  and  SMEs  in  business  and  enterprise  management.  Sharing  of  innovations  across  the  livestock  product  (and  other  agricultural)  value  chains  is  also  essential  for  market-led  agricultural  extension  and  supply  chain  management.  Public  extension  services  are  often  not  well  equipped  to  implement  such  capacity  development  activities  effectively,  but  public  funds  can  help  increase  the  budget  of  NGOs,  industry  bodies  and  farmers  organizations  to  implement  capacity  development  activities  that  are  in  line  with  wider  livestock  sector  development  objectives,  agreed  upon  by  the  whole  industry  in  a  consultative  process.   Livestock vaccines  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 5c, 6a  Medical  and  veterinary  vaccine  inventions  are  among  the  most  cost-effective  disease  control  interventions  ever  deployed.  They  have  enabled  the  global  eradication  of  two  lethal  diseases,  e.g.,  smallpox in humans (1979) and rinderpest in cattle and wild ungulates (2011). Vaccines against livestock  diseases have the power to reduce livestock mortality, sustainably increase productivity, increase food  and  nutritional  security,  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor  and  help  developing  economies  grow.  Extensive quarantine, diagnosis and slaughter of livestock are not sustainable disease control options in  developing  countries.  Vaccines  are  essential  in  preventing  the  spread  of  disease.  Diseases  of  tropical  origin are now threatening developed countries. For example African Swine Fever has reached Europe  and is threatening the pig industry there.  Despite the importance of vaccines, many of the diseases that affect livestock in developing countries  are neglected. There is an under-investment in this critical area of livestock agriculture. The situation is  exacerbated by a general lack of capacity to undertake early phase research in developing countries and  a lack of biotechnology related enterprises. Priority livestock diseases include African Swine fever (ASF),  contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), East Coast fever (ECF), peste de petits ruminants (PPR) and  Rift Valley fever (RVF). The latter is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from livestock to people.  Live  pathogen  based  vaccines  exist  against  CBPP,  ECF,  PPR  and  RVF.  For  ASF  there  is  no  vaccine  and  preventing the spread of virus is the only realistic method of disease control.   Although  the  existing  vaccines  are  often  sub-optimal  in  nature  and  require  cold  chain  facilities  for  delivery,  they  can  be  used  until  more  effective  vaccines  are  developed.  With  advances  in  molecular  techniques, investment in the development of a new generation of subunit vaccines and vaccines that  are  thermostable  could  have  huge  rewards  in  the  next  10  years.  This  would  also  help  spawn  a  new  generation of scientists to continue battling on the front lines of the ever-evolving arms race between  health and disease.  Doubling animal productivity with better use of crop residues  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 5c, 6a  Crop residues such as straws, stover and haulms form the basal diet of hundreds of millions of livestock  in smallholder systems throughout developing countries. These feeds have low to moderate nutritional  value but even moderate improvements in their quality have substantial effects on livestock productivity  - a one percent increase in digestibility results in 6 to 8% increase in livestock outputs. In most crops   62  different cultivars have different nutritive values. For example, digestibility varies in cowpea, sorghum,  pearl millet and groundnut by 3 to 5 percentage units and in rice straw by 10 percentage units. These  differences  can  be  exploited  when  farmers  choose  cultivars  with  better  nutritive  value,  without  detriment  to  grain  or  pod  yields.  Fodder  traders  are  well  aware  of  these  important  differences  in  nutritive value. For example in sorghum stover traded in India, a one percent difference in digestibility  was associated with a price difference of 5%. Feeding trials showed that feeding sorghum stover with a  digestibility of 52% compared to 47% as part of a mixed diet increased daily milk yield in buffaloes from  10 to 15 kg. Studies of the Indian dairy industry show that improving the basal diets of crop residues,  coupled with feed processing and fortification could double the milk yield per animal without requiring  more grain that can be directly used for human consumption.  With  the  rising  availability  of  fast,  cheap  laboratory  methods  all  new  varieties  of  crops  should  be  screened for nutritive value of crop residues and this information made available to farmers along with  data on yield, disease resistance, etc. so that they can make informed choices about the varieties that  they select for growing. Indian sorghum breeders have pioneered this approach with nutritive value of  crop residues being one of the criteria used for release of new varieties. Extension of this to the release  criteria  of  crops  in  other  national  programs  should  be  a  priority.  Fodder  quality  traits,  such  as  digestibility and nitrogen content should be incorporated into crop improvement programs  this can be  done without impacting grain yield. Targeted genetic enhancement for food and feed/fodder traits using  recurrent  selection,  hybridization,  marker  assisted  selection  and  QTL  identification  and  backcrossing  should be mainstreamed into crop breeding.   include  a)  implementation  of  sustainable  Climate-smart agriculture  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 8b, 8c  Climate-Smart  Agriculture  is  not  a  single,  specific  agricultural  technology  or  practice  that  can  be  universally  applied.  It  is  an  approach  that  requires  site-specific  assessments  to  identify  suitable  agricultural  technologies  and  practices  that  aim  to  increase  productivity  in  an  environmentally  and  socially  sustainable  way,  strengthen  farmers'  resilience  to  climate  change,  and  reduce  agriculture's  contribution to climate change by reducing GHG emissions and sequestering more carbon200. Typical CSA  investment  areas  land  management  practices  (e.g.  conservation  agriculturey,  agroforestry,  integrated  livestock  management,  and  water  harvesting),  b)  climate risk management (e.g., drought-tolerant varieties, early warning systems, climate forecasts, and  use  of  ICT  tools  for  disseminating  weather  information),  and  c)  transformation  of  whole  production  systems. Innovative policy instruments and financing mechanisms that link investments from the public  and private sectors are key components for implementation. CSA includes activities that communities,  villages,  districts  and  higher  government  levels  can  take,  for  example  to  provide  a  back-up  in  case  of  crop or animal production failures.   Implementing CSA approaches is often challenging, partly due to a lack of tools, technology and data  (especially down-scaled weather data) to support the integration of multiple interventions at the farm  level.  Climate-smart  interventions  are  highly  location-specific  and  knowledge-intensive.  Considerable  efforts are required to develop the knowledge and capacities of a wide range of stakeholders. Rainfall is                                                               y Most efforts to date in developing countries have promoted conservation agriculture as a package of three practices:  minimum disturbance of soil (zero, minimum, or reduced tillage); retention of sufficient crop residue to provide surface  coverage; and diversified cropping patterns that usually also include a legume. Except for North and South America,  widespread adoption of this package has not yet occurred, but there is evidence for adoption of one or two of these  components in some areas in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia201.  63  low  rainfall  events  and  trigger  payments.  One  such  example  often the greatest production risk farmers face. Instruments to manage this risk include weather index  insurance,  drought  tolerant  and  water-efficient  varieties,  conservation  agriculture  practices,  water  harvesting  and  supplemental  irrigation  technologies.  New  commercial  micro-insurance  models  are  emerging that hold promise when integrated with input credit programs and local weather stations to  validate  is  the  Kilimo  Salama  (http://kilimosalama.wordpress.com)  program  in  Western  Kenya  that  uses  an  existing  mobile  money  platform to make payments to eligible customers. The integration of satellite radar and local automated  reporting rain gages will be critical to support weather indexed credit and insurance.  In the MasAgro  (http://masagro.mx/index.php/en) program in Mexico, federal and state agencies are aligning policies  and  incentives  to  enhance  the  adoption  of  conservation  agriculture  practices  for  wheat  and  maize  production, for increased productivity and resilience to weather variability, especially rainfall. Another  example are policies that provide incentives to reduce GHG emissions associated with rice in Vietnam.    Increasing resilience to pests and diseases  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 9a  As  cropping  systems  intensify,  the  potential  for  losses  due  to  insects,  diseases  and  weeds  (together  termed  pests  hereafter)  will  increase  if  it  is  not  actively  managed.  This  may  be  exacerbated  by  the  increased climate variability that is predicted over the next four decades, which could favor the rapid  buildup  of  pests  and  disease  populations.  Pest  risk  will  be  compounded  by  increased  movement  of  humans,  food  and  natural  products  among  countries.  Over  the  past  four  decades,  integrated  pest  management (IPM, http://pesticidestewardship.org/ipm) has emerged as a widely accepted approach to  manage  pests  using  host  plant  resistance  combined  with  cultural,  biological  and  chemical  control  methods202.   Genetic  resistance  can  be  effective  at  the  variety,  population  and  landscape  levels  in  reducing  risk  related to pests and other stressors.  When resistance is built into the genetics of the crop or livestock  variety,  it  is  easily  replicated  and  distributed  to  and  among  farmers.  Breeding  resistance  traits  into  commercial crops and livestock has become more effective with the advent of modern molecular tools  that  enable  scientists  to  identify  the  different  versions  of  a  gene  (called  alleles)  responsible  for  resistance and track their integration with other resistance traits into a single variety. For some pests,  natural diversity does not provide adequate control, which may require genetic engineering solutions.  For most pests, however, natural diversity for resistance exists and can be utilized through breeding and  population management. Cultural controls include crop rotation management, intercropping, agronomic  practices  that  improve  the  health  of  the  plant  or  animal  to  naturally  resist  or  tolerate  attack,  or  the  management of habitat reservoirs. New \"ecological engineering\" approaches aim to support populations  of  biological  control  agents  that  can  regulate  pest  populations  below  economic  damage  levels.  One  example of this is the Push-Pull mechanism used in Kenya to control stemborers and Striga in maize.  Desmodium  (a  perennial  legume)  is  intercropped  with  maize  to  push  or  repel  stemborers  and  to  suppress Striga, and Napier grass is planted outside the field to pull or attract stemborers away from  the maize crop203. Both Desmodium and Napier are valuable fodder crops for the Kenyan smallholder  dairy industry.  Given  the  knowledge  intensive  nature  of  many  IPM  practices,  few  examples  of  wide-scale,  sustained  adoption exist. However, ICTs are now improving access by researchers and extension agents to pest  and disease diagnostic tools. Along with improved population modeling and weather data, IPM is now  well  positioned  to  leverage  digital  platforms  to  support  frontline  extension  agents  and  farmers  in  implementing preemptive management practices. Improved weather data will be required  especially  for regions with the most dramatic weather variability. ICT tools and community-based crop clinics such   64  as the Plantwise initiative of CABI (www.plantwise.org) and its partners are already offering improved  access to a growing knowledge base for pest and disease management solutions. Policies that support  integrated  approaches  to  pest  and  disease  control  will  be  important  to  avoid  the  unintended  consequences experienced 50 years ago with the introduction and over-reliance on synthetic pesticides  as  a  silver-bullet  for  control.  Most  importantly,  input  suppliers,  extension  professionals  and  farmers  need  to  be  trained  well  in  all  aspects  of  modern  pest  management,  including  pesticide  stewardship  (www.croplife.org/crop_protection_stewardship) to minimize environmental or health risks.  Innovative smallholder technologies to increase crop value, reduce postharvest losses, and improve  food safety  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a  Because farmers are often unable to dry, store and process their produce, losses are high and there is  widespread contamination of foodstuffs with microbes and mycotoxins.  For example, most vegetables  and  high-value  food  crops  are  at  peak  quality  at  harvest  but  start  to  deteriorate  soon  afterwards.  Moisture loss and physical damage during harvest, packing, storage and transportation causes losses of  20 - 80%204. The loss of produce volume, nutritional content and quality mean that consumers pay more  for products which are less beneficial to their nutritional security. Reducing postharvest losses of these  products  will  increase  the  incomes  of  the  producers  and  the  availability  of  micronutrients  for  all.  For  starchy  staples  such  as  root,  tuber  and  cereal  crops,  as  well  as  for  many  legumes,  proper  drying  and  storage is also critical to avoid the buildup of toxic compounds such as aflatoxin and fumonisin, which  are produced by molds.   Various  postharvest  handling  methods  are  already  available  to  help  deliver  more  produce  of  better  quality to the point of sale. The methods reduce moisture loss and physical damage at every step along  the  chain  from  field  and  harvest  to  consumers.  Growers  should  use  the  most  appropriate  crops  to  withstand the local environment, transportation and market challenges205. These varieties must be well  adapted to biotic and abiotic constraints, and have morphological and physiological traits to assure the  produce reaches the consumer in optimum condition and is acceptable. Best practices must be used:  harvest at optimum maturity and at cooler times of the day and keep produce in the shade to reduce  temperature  and  moisture  loss;  use  harvesting  tools  and  storage  containers  that  do  not  inflict  unnecessary  damage  to  the  produce;  grade  the  produce  to  remove  damage  or  diseased  materials  to  minimize  microbial  spoilage;  and  clean  and  pack  into  uniform  lots  to  attract  higher  prices.  In  many  developing countries, keeping produce cool is a big challenge: simple evaporative coolers are already  available,  and  mechanisms  to  adapt  air-conditioners  to  reduce  temperatures  further  have  been  developed206.  Other  postharvest  techniques  which  can  suit  smallholder  producers  are  various  drying  techniques to retain quality and improve shelf-life, modified atmosphere packaging, and food processing  to increase shelf-life, retain nutrients and add value.  To reduce postharvest losses, growers and processors must be able to know what economic losses occur  and are avoidable. The information must help guide stakeholders, in both the public and private sectors,  to identify constraints and opportunities. Active participation of all stakeholders is needed to identify  the best postharvest management packages. Policy constraints also need to be addressed  all in the  context  of  delivering  safe,  health-promoting  foods  to  consumers  with  minimal  wastage.  Preferred  postharvest practices must be validated; profitable technologies will encourage confidence among the  growers  and  value-chain  actors  to  adopt  the  technologies.  Further  mechanisms  for  adding  value  may  include certification, further cleaning and produce sanitation, and preparation of vegetables ready for  cooking to meet the needs of busy urban consumers who need to save time in food preparation. Centers  of  excellence  for  postharvest  management  may  be  an  ideal  mechanism  to  provide  necessary  advice,  65  services,  tools  and  materials  to  empower  growers  and  other  actors  along  the  value  chain  to  make  greater positive impact on their health and livelihoods by delivering more and better quality produce.  New business models for smallholder farming and marketing  Main contributions: Targets 1a, 6a, 6c, 8c  Where  structural  transformation  processes  in  urban  and  rural  areas  proceed  rapidly,  traditional  smallholder  farming  will  more  and  more  be  supplemented  or  replaced  with  outsourcing  of  farming  operations,  the  formation  of  small  and  medium-size  farmer  cooperatives  or  agribusiness  enterprises,  and  contract  farming207.  Value  chains  for  major  agricultural  commodities  will  become  more  tightly  integrated because processors and consumers demand more information and control over how food is  being  produced,  with  supermarket  chains  playing  a  particularly  important  role.  For  farmers  this  is  a  chance  to  connect  with  rapidly  growing  domestic  and  export  markets  and  thus  become  more  direct  beneficiaries of competitive food systems. The food industry in particular has increased investments in  direct-sourcing  of  agricultural  produce  from  small  farmers  worldwide,  a  trend  that  is  expected  to  continue due to increasing industry and consumer demands for tracing food and meeting certified as  well  as  non-certified  production  standards  (e.g.,  Good  Agricultural  Practice  www.globalgap.org  or  the  SAI Platform www.saiplatform.org).  Many  countries  and  businesses  are  now  experimenting  with  such  new  forms  of  market-oriented  smallholder farming. They are often linked to supermarkets and food processing chains and can lead to  substantial  income  gains  for  the  participating  farmers  as  well  as  better  access  to  inputs,  services  and  new technologies207,208. A quiet revolution towards more vertical integration of value chains is already  occurring  in  many  countries  of  Asia,  where  urban  areas  typically  account  for  half  the  population  and  two-thirds to three-quarters of its food demand (Box 4-5)79.   Structural and value chain transformations of this nature could become key vehicles for improving the  income of small farmers, creating attractive jobs in rural areas, and providing affordable, safe, nutritious  food  to  urban  consumers.  They  also  provide  entry  points  for  reducing  food  waste,  particularly  food  which perishes between farm and market in the developing world. They are opportunities for solutions  that combine food industry and agribusiness development and market competitiveness with the food  security  and  poverty  alleviation  agenda.  More  and  larger-scale  pilots  are  needed  to  develop  inclusive  and  sustainable  business  models  for  such  a  transformation  of  smallholder  farming,  including  good  compliance mechanisms80,209.   Box 4-5. The quiet revolution in staple food value chains in Asia79  Transformational  changes in rice and potato value chains  are occurring in Bangladesh, India and China. This  includes a rapid rise of supermarkets, modern cold storages, large rice mills, and commercialized small farmers  using  input-intensive,  mechanized  technologies.  Although  there  is  great  heterogeneity  in  farm  sizes  and  distribution of non-land assets, all  farmers, regardless of how small  their plots are, are commercializing and  benefitting. Markets for farm machinery, water and land are active. Through mobile phones farmers are much  better  informed  on  what,  how,  and  for  whom  to  produce.  In  the  midstream  segments  of  the  value  chain,  driven by the private sector, rice mills are modernizing and cold storage facilities for potatoes have expanded  rapidly to meet the  demands  of new off-season urban  markets. The rise of cold storage has brought  higher  incomes  for  potato  farmers  and  all-season  access  for  potato  consumers.  Processors  now  buy  directly  from  farmers so they can do their own branding and packaging, as supermarkets have penetrated urban food retail,  shifting from loose, unbranded staples to packaged, branded staples with traceability in the supply chain. Off- farm components of the value chains account for 36-40% of the total margins in these new rice and potato  chains,  illustrating  the  importance  of  increasing  the  productivity  of  processing,  storage  and  distribution  of  food.     66  Digital agriculture  Main contributions: All targets  Digital technologies will be a key enabler to grapple with the complexity of SAI and taking it to scale.  Mobile phones, interactive radio, video and internet can enable farmers to access location-specific and  timely recommendations that are actionable, but also to contribute to gathering large-scale datasets on  the performance of agricultural options (varieties, planting dates, etc.) Crowd-sourcing can help fill data  gaps and thus improve the tailoring of recommendations. Mobile technologies in particular are a vehicle  to not only integrate improved varieties, agronomy and policies to support food systems, but also as the  mechanism  to  integrate  other  key  services  such  as  credit,  insurance,  education  and  health.  Digitally- enabled technologies can drive transparency that in turn supports accountability and ultimately leads to  good governance  an essential ingredient for development. Governments need to embrace the era of  digitally-enabled  exchange  of  information  and  learning  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  development,  democratize information, and empower farmers, consumers and investors to make informed choices.  Strong public-private partnerships will be required to realize the full potential of digital technology along  value chains. Examples of digital agriculture applications include:   National and sub-national scorecards that track key indicators related to food security, nutrition  and environmental sustainability of national food systems.    High-resolution  satellite  imagery  to  support  land  tenure  processes  so  farmers  can  invest  with  confidence in improving their land.   Digital data, maps and spatial application services for deriving customized products according to  user specifications. Examples include the Global Yield Gap Atlas (www.yieldgap.org) or the Africa  Soil Information Service (www.africasoils.net).     Data  platforms  to  support  farmer  research  networks  conducting  simple  experiments  on  large    scales to support improved deployment of germplasm and other agricultural options.  Smartphone  platforms  for  location-specific  delivery  of  crop  status  information  and  forecasts,  based  on  high-resolution,  real-time  crop  monitoring  by  satellites,  cloud-based  processing,  weather data and crop simulation models.  Smartphones  used  for  plant  disease  diagnosis  or  nutrient  management  decision-making  (e.g.,  NM Rice www.irri.org/nmrice).   Video technology and monitoring platforms for farmer-to-farmer extension, e.g., Digital Green  (www.digitalgreen.org).   Commodity  exchanges  accessible  by  mobile  phones  that  give  farmers  access  to  markets  and  secure  higher  prices  while  processors  benefit  from  high  quality  raw  materials  based  on  transparent grades and standards and easier aggregation of primary products.

Promoting integrated landscape management  Main contributions: most Targets   To address the challenges of food insecurity, persistent poverty, climate change, ecosystem degradation  and  biodiversity  loss  successfully,  it  is  critical  to  move  beyond  zero-sum  strategies  that  solve  one  problem  but  exacerbate  others.  Integrated  landscape  management  aims  to  realize  synergies  and  reduce trade-offs among these multiple objectives. Farmers and land managers around the world are  reaching  out  across  traditional  sectoral  boundaries  to  forge  partnerships  with  conservation  organizations,  local  governments,  businesses  and  others  to  solve  problems  that  are  inter-connected.  More than 107 such initiatives have been documented in Latin America, over 85 in Africa and an Asian  inventory is underway210,211. However, current institutionsstill sectorally siloedprovide weak support  for  these  efforts.  In  Lari-Kijabe  in  Kenya,  smallholder  farmer  organizations  are  partnering  with  local  governments,  banks  and  conservation  groups  to  expand  agricultural  markets  and  protect  high- conservation value forests and watersheds. In the Maasai Steppeland of Tanzania, commercial avocado  producers,  pastoralists  and  conservation  organizations  are  partnering  to  raise  incomes  and  food  security,  while  protecting  wildlife.  In  Tigray,  Ethiopia,  restoration  of  highly  degraded  watersheds  by   community-government-NGO  partnerships  have  enabled  irrigation  and  water  access,  increased  food  production, and greatly reduced the need for food aid during droughts.   In  2012,  a  global  coalition  of  more  than  50  agriculture,  environment  and  development  organizations  came  Initiative  (www.landscapes.ecoagriculture.org).  The  Initiative  is  advancing  viable  pathways  for  sustainable  development  in  places  where  food  production,  ecosystem  health  and  human  wellbeing  must  be  achieved simultaneously. The top priority is to strengthen the capacity of existing landscape initiatives  and mobilize cross-site learning, coordinated investment and documentation. To accelerate the scaling  up  of  integrated  landscape  approaches,  the  Initiative  is  assisting  countries  to  put  in  place  supportive  policy  frameworks,  encouraging  businesses  to  pursue  sustainable  sourcing  through  landscape  partnerships,  expanding  financing  for  integrated  landscape  investments  and  promoting  science  and  knowledge systems for landscape solutions.  for  People,  Food  and  Nature   Landscapes  together  to  implement  the  Transforming China's agriculture  Main contributions: Targets 5c, 6a, 6b, 6c, 8b, 9a, 9c  China produces the bulk of its food on millions of tiny farms, but hundreds of millions of people have  already left the countryside in recent decades. China also imports huge amounts of agricultural products  from other regions. Success in transforming the global food system will also depend on whether China  can transform its agriculture. The sheer size of its population and food consumption, and the rapid pace  of  its  economic  development  have  already  strained  land,  water,  and  other  resources,  leading  to  widespread environmental problems and food safety concerns. SAI will have to become the cornerstone  for future food security and rural development in China. Perhaps the biggest challenge for China is to  find \"double high SAI solutions that ensure high yields with high resource use efficiency, and also meet  higher  environmental  protection  and  land  quality  standards.  Being  the  world's  largest  fertilizer  consumer, more effective nutrient management is of particular significance for China because current  application rates of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are high, whereas their use efficiencies  are often very low. Solving this problem requires better congruence between crop nutrient demand and  nutrient  supply  from  soil,  fertilizer  and  other  sources.  The  technologies  and  diagnostic  tools  needed  have been developed by Chinese researchers, demonstrating that large gains in yields, income, water   68  and nutrient use efficiency could be achieved182,212,213216. Adoption of such approaches could also lead to  substantial  reductions  in  GHG  emissions.  Nitrogen  fertilizer-related  emissions  constitute  about  7%  of  GHG emissions from the entire Chinese economy. Mitigation opportunities include improving methane  recovery during coal mining, enhancing energy efficiency in fertilizer manufacture, and increasing the  efficiency of N fertilizer use at the field-level. This could cut N fertilizer-related emissions by 2063%,  which would decrease Chinas total GHG emissions by 26%43.  The  main  challenge  is  how  to  upscale  knowledge-intensive  management  practices  through  suitable  policies and extension models for different types of farming in China212. In small households with 0.5 ha  land,  double  high  agriculture  requires  organizing  small  farms  into  somewhat  larger  land  units  and  working  closely  with  farmers  through  village-based  agricultural  experts.  This  should  also  be  tied  into  new business models for farming in China, such as small to medium agribusinesses, cooperatives and  contract  farming208,214.  In  contrast,  large  farms  are  found  in  Northeast  China,  with  each  household  managing 25 ha or more land with modern machinery and good access to professional extension experts.  In  this  case,  even  information  technology-based  management  and  large-scale  agricultural  service  models have been tested and successfully adopted by these large-scale farms. Agricultural technology  extension  in  China  predominantly  relies  on  public  sector  activities,  with  only  a  small,  complementary  role for the private sector. With further development of the Chinese economy the role of the private  sector in research and extension of agriculture technology is becoming more important. Based on the  characteristics of the main bodies involved in China, the approaches for agricultural technology transfer  and extension for high-yield and high-efficiency crop production can include: (1) farm-based approaches  for  promoting  knowledge  transfer  to  farmers;  (2)  enterprise-based  approaches  for  incorporating  knowledge into commercial products; and (3) government-based approaches for improving the national  extension network212.   Monitoring the worlds agricultural systems   Main contributions: all Targets   Effective monitoring networks are essential to track, anticipate and manage changes in the biophysical,  economic, and social aspects of different farming systems around the world143,167. A global agricultural  monitoring  system  should  be  established  as  a  well-designed  and  well-directed  network  of  partners  engaged in collecting high-quality data required by a wide range of stakeholders. It would provide up to  date  information  on  the  status  of  agriculture  and  progress  towards  meeting  the  agreed  future  SDG  Targets,  including  environmental  targets  affected  by  agriculture.  Simultaneously  measuring  indicators  across SDGs - including many of those proposed in Chapter 3 - in an integrated monitoring system will  allow scientists, land managers and other decision makers alike to find solutions to the most pressing  problems  facing  global  food  security.  It  would  help  direct  public  and  private  investments,  and  would  allow for quantification of the multifunctional aspects of agriculture and food systems in a comparable  manner across scales.   Such a monitoring system would build on existing but often disconnected monitoring efforts. It would  supplement and improve existing national and global statistics with high quality data collected at farm,  landscape and regional scales. Both universal and site-specific metrics are needed to detect change over  time and across scales167. This would include, for example, more precise data such as crop and livestock  yields, weather data so that yields can be adjusted for climate variability, yield gaps based on simulation  of yield potential and measurement of actual yields, nutrient application rates, budgets and efficiencies,  crop  losses  by  pests  and  diseases,  water  use  and  efficiency,  measures  of  soil  quality  and  ecological  resilience, availability of credit and machinery, household income, and low-cost genetic fingerprinting to  assess the diversity of the main crop varieties and animal breeds. It would utilize adaptive monitoring  and hierarchical design strategies to address specific and new questions or hypotheses, including those  69  that  are  subject  to  much  public  debate,  such  as  the  impacts  of  GM  crops  or  tradeoffs  of  organic  agriculture. Universities and International Agricultural Research Centers (the CGIAR and others), could  play a major role in such an effort because they have thousands of experts in various disciplines and  thousands  of  partners  on  the  ground.  An  interdisciplinary  monitoring  network  would  also  provide  unique,  exciting  opportunities  for  students  and  others  to  learn  about  the  science  and  practice  of  sustainable agriculture. The monitoring work would have to tie in with national statistical agencies, UN  agencies and others who collect and analyze data on agriculture and associated and natural ecosystems,  to  overcome  many  of  the  current  weaknesses  in  data  coverage  and  quality  (see  Chapter  5.2).  International donors should allocate sufficient amounts of long-term funding to support such an effort,  which  would  benefit  them  and  countries  in  making  better  decisions  and  tracking  returns  on  investments.  4.3. Investing in long-term change  Foresight is needed to avoid running into another food crisis 20 or 30 years from now. In addition to  investing in early solutions or technologies that are likely to become available in the next 5 to 10 years,  strategic  investments  are  needed  to  sustain  and  even  accelerate  the  rate  of  progress  over  time.  This  requires  large,  stable  investments  in  two  major  areas:  (1)  agricultural  research  with  potentially  high  payoffs and (2) strengthening the capacity of National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS), including  human resources development at all levels, from science to extension215,216.   For  some  10,000  years  farming  made  progress  through  observation,  tinkering  and  trial  and  error.  Organized  agricultural  research  has  only  been  conducted  for  about  200  years.  Its  success  has  been  spectacular,  leading  to  a  steady  accumulation  of  knowledge  as  well  as  massive  breakthroughs  in  the  performance  of  agriculture.  It  has  been  demonstrated  numerous  times  that  rates  of  return  on  investment in agricultural R&D are high in both developed and developing countriesz, that spillover of  innovations among countries is substantial, and that investments in R&D often have large, long-lasting  cross-sectoral growth benefits4,215,217-219. It has also been shown that countries that have heavily invested  in  R&D,  extension,  and  measures  that  favor  long-term  business  and  infrastructure  development  for  commercialization  of  new  knowledge  and  technologies  have  also  had  the  strongest  productivity  growth5,220. Further, investments in R&D can have significant impacts on productivity growth even in the  absence of improvements in infrastructure or extension, whereas the reverse is usually not the case5.  Despite  this  track  record  and  a  modest  increase  in  funding  in  recent  years,  agricultural  R&D  expenditures remain far too low in most countries. In 2008/9, global public spending on agricultural R&D  totaled  about  US$32-34  billion,  split  about  evenly  between  high-income  and  low/middle-income  countries163,221. Private sector investments add another US$15-20 billion, 90% of which is in high-income  countries. Altogether agriculture and food only account for about 5% of total global science spending.  Moreover,  Brazil,  China  and  India  alone  account  for  half  of  all  agricultural  R&D  spending  in  the  low/medium income category, whereas many low- and middle-income countries still have very limited  R&D capacity. It has been estimated that nearly half of the world's agricultural science knowledge stock  has been generated by just seven countries, with the USA, Japan, and China accounting  for one third221.  There is no plausible reason for why returns on investments in agricultural R&D could be lower in the  future.  Investments  in  public  agricultural  research  should  be  doubled  within  the  next  10  years215  and  they need to be of a long-term, strategic nature, not driven by short-term thinking and bureaucracy that                                                               z Annualized rates of return vary by country and type of innovation, but often range from 20% to 80% in agricultural research in  developing countries. Calculations of rates of return may sometimes be biased because failures may not be included in impact  studies or because attribution to research is difficult to quantify for some technologies and policy interventions.   70  causes  high  transaction  costs.  Although  private  sector  funding  for  agricultural  R&D  has  risen  substantially in recent years, questions must be raised as to whether it can really substitute for public  R&D222. Generally speaking, private sector R&D is concentrated on fewer commodities, technologies and  markets  than  public  R&D  and  the  intellectual  property  created  is  not  equally  accessible.  Moreover,  a  decline  in  public  sector  funding  would  also  lead  to  a  decline  in  basic  research  needed  to  create  new  technology opportunities for the private sector, as well as a decline in the training of human resources  needed by the private sector. Hence, a balanced approach is needed, including increased investments in  public R&D on agriculture and food systems, but with better R&D funding mechanisms that create more  space for scientists to actually be able to do creative science.   Larger, more predictable and less restrictive support for R&D involves investing in strong pipelines of  both basic and applied research. Both are interlinked and need to be funded in parallel. Many exciting  new ideas have been proposed or are already being pursued by research groups worldwide, addressing  fundamental questions in agricultural sciences223,224. Most of them require large, longer-term public and  private  sector  investment  and  effective  collaboration  of  scientists  worldwide.  Some  examples  for  potential future breakthroughs are shown in Box 4-6.   Investing  in  creating  and  retaining  a  new  generation  of  agricultural  scientists  and  professionals    including more women  will be vital for achieving any of the post-2015 agricultural goals. Huge human  resource  gaps  persist  in  many  developing  countries,  particularly  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  but  with  the  exception  of  China  and  India  also  in  most  countries  of  Asia.  A  generation  gap  is  opening  up  due  to  retirements and lacking investments in human resources development during the past 20 years. We can  achieve  a  lot  with  new  technologies,  but  only  if  we  have  dedicated  people  who  develop  them,  make  sure  that  they  meet  farmers  and  businesses  needs,  and  bring  them  towards  application.  Robots,  computers,  the  internet  or  smartphones  cannot  do  this.  They  are  helpful  tools,  but  not  the  primary  means for innovation and enacting behavior change in the complex world of agriculture. Public science  education  on  food,  agricultural  and  environmental  issues  needs  to  be  strengthened  all  the  way  from  primary  education  to  college.  Curricula  should  be  upgraded  to  include  the  best  available  science  of  sustainable agricultural intensification in an exciting manner, thus encouraging young people to become  part of the transformative changes needed by seeking a career in the agriculture and food sectors. A  global classroom, a network of knowledge centers who become global, regional and national leaders in  agricultural  sustainability  science  and  practice,  should  be  formed  to  raise  the  profile  of  agricultural  science,  mobilize  action,  connect  young  people  worldwide,  and  also  educate  business  executives  and  political leaders.   National  Agricultural  Research  Systems  (NARS)aa are  the  backbone  of  agricultural  development  in  a  country, but many will require a complete overhaul and even whole new models in order to be able to  fulfill  their  mandate.  At  present,  many  are  too  weak  in  terms  of  human  capital,  infrastructure,  operational  funding,  incentives,  management  and  governance  to  undertake  the  work  that  will  be  required216. In many countries, NARS still depend highly on donor funding, which also creates volatility  risks  for  pursuing  a  long-term  national  agenda.  While  international  donors  should  be  encouraged  to  invest more in both international and national agricultural R&D systems, most low- to middle-income  countries should also aim to spend at least 1% of their agricultural GDP to support public agricultural  R&D in their country. At present, most developing countries spend only about 0.5% of agricultural GDP  on  R&D163.  Modernization  of  NARS  and  greater  financial  support  should  be  an  integral  component  of  comprehensive  national  agricultural  development  and  investment  strategies,  following  an  integrated,                                                               aa Here we focus primarily on public sector research. The term National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES) is  often used to describe the entire system of research and extension organizations in a country.  71  inclusive  approach  that  is  country-owned.  Many  good  suggestions  have  been  made  and  various  new  models have already been tried in recent years for modernizing national agricultural research as well as  extension systems216,226.    Box 4-6. Blue-sky research that could lead to future transformative changes in agriculture and food systems      Massive discovery of genes functions by sequencing and phenotyping the worlds collections of wild and  domesticated  crop  and  animal  species,  and  using  that  know-how  in  conventional  and  biotechnology  applications  for  accelerating  next  generation  crop  and  animal  breeding.  The  revolutions  in  biological  sciences and information technology have put this exciting opportunity at our fingertips. Potential returns  on such investments are huge and broad, including for small farms worldwide.    Re-engineering  crop  photosynthesis  to  increase  yields  and  make  crops  more  resource-efficient.  Introducing C4-photosynthesis into a C3 crop such as rice could produce 30-50% more yield for the same  amount  of  sunshine,  water  and  nitrogen.  The  metabolic  components  already  exist  in  C3  rice  plants.  However, the anatomical and biochemical features of C4 plants must be understood and transferred to  rice plants. This is currently being pursued by a group of scientists from the International Rice Research  Institute (IRRI) and advanced institutions around the world in the international C4 Rice Consortium, who  hope to construct a functioning C4 rice plant within the next 20 years113.  Genetic  improvements  to  increase  the  nitrogen  use  efficiency  in  non-leguminous  crops,  including  engineering a mechanism for fixing atmospheric N2 into such crop species225. The three major cereals (rice,  wheat, maize) account for about 50% of global nitrogen fertilizer consumption. A breakthrough in nitrogen  use  efficiency  of  such  staple  crops  would  help  decouple  rising  food  production  from  rising  fertilizer  consumption, and make farming more profitable.   Cost-effective small-scale production of ammonia integrated with renewable energy generation to meet  local  fertilizer  supply  needs  and  store  energy  in  fertilizer  to  buffer  intermittent  supplies  of  electrical  energy41.   Smart fertilizer technologies and/or genetic improvements that could double the crop recovery efficiency  of applied phosphorus fertilizer. Typically, only 20-25% of the P applied with fertilizer is recovered by the  crop in the first growing season. Although it can be increased through better nutrient management and  stewardship  programs  in  low-performing  areas,  new  technology  could  enable  increasing  short-  and/or  long-term phosphorus efficiency. This would be more profitable for farmers, and also reduce the risk of P  losses.  Next generation biofuels and other bioenergy solutions that are more energy efficient, use crop residues  and biomass waste, and dont consume more agricultural land or natural ecosystems.   Environment-independent,  self-sustained  skyfarming118  or  other  forms  of  vertical  urban  agriculture  and  horticulture, as part of local food chains.   Semi-autonomous farm robots for precision farming at different scales, including for performing tasks that  are difficult, laborious or dangerous to humans.  Edible, commercially viable 'synthetic' meat grown under controlled, energy-efficient conditions to replace  livestock products.  New products made from agricultural by-products and waste, including recycling of chemical elements for  other uses.  Innovative  payment  and  (digital)  monitoring  schemes  for  environmental  services  that  incentivize  the  implementation of high ecological and social standards at landscape scale.  Food market system innovations that can incentivize species and landscape diversity in agriculture, e.g.,  whole new storage facilities and computerized delivery systems for diverse products.              72  Generally  speaking,  there  is  a  need  to  (i)  move  from  supply-driven  to  demand-driven  agricultural  innovation systems that focus on the right priorities, including active participation by key stakeholders,  and (ii) simplify the increasing complexity, fragmentation and lack of coordination of agricultural R&D  funding. New, visionary R&D funding models are needed that    Are founded in strategic long-term thinking;    Have a clear outcome-focus and reward quality science and proven impact;    Enable public-private collaboration in R&D and extension to cover all areas sufficiently and make    Build human capital.  faster progress;   Encourage open access to information, data and other intellectual properties;   Create a viable market for R&D outputs and innovation services;   Enhance cross-border learning, cooperation and technology spillover;    Stimulate  more  private  investments  in  R&D  and  direct  it  to  areas  of  public  interest, including  attracting new investors such as venture capital and social impact investors;  Systematically improve public R&D infrastructure; and   73  5. Planning and implementing action Implementation  of  the  new  SDGs  through  targets,  indicators,  planning  and  investments  should  be  scalable from local to global levels, and must also be measureable at all levels and scales. The pathways  towards more sustainable agriculture and food systems will vary by country as well as within countries,  but could follow some common principles (Box 5-1).   In every village there is a huge diversity of households, from relatively better off to abjectly poor. Each  country and each locality must choose its own agricultural transformation paths, and prioritize concrete  solutions for them. Market-driven economic and technological growth will not be sufficient to achieve  the necessary, deep transformation of the global food system because it lacks the incentives to confront  all of the challenges that need to be tackled. Good governance  supported by good metrics  needs to  direct  the  transformation  process.  Not  all  goals  of  sustainable  agriculture  and  food  systems  can  be  achieved immediately and simultaneously because the challenges and uncertainties are simply too large  and  complex.  Perfect,  quick  solutions  rarely  exist.  Multiple  actionable  changes  are  the  basis  for  moving  towards  achieving  a  major  goal.  A  risk  minimization  strategy  also  offers  greater  potential  for  ownership and building consensus that results in real change. Its goal is to find ways of moving forward  rather  than  seeking  ultimate  solutions  that  do  not  address  the  diverse,  pressing  needs  of  different  countries, which too often result in no action being taken77. It may also include drastic actions that may  have to be taken in certain cases, such as policies and good governance mechanisms that slow down and  halt the destruction of forests or natural wetlands, the depletion of water resources, and the conversion  of fertile agricultural land into housing and industrial zones, or provide the necessary controls over food  quality and safety.   Planning for success requires an implementation plan that provides a roadmap to realize strategic goals.  While the high-level SDGs for the post-2015 era will galvanize the global community to work towards  shared development goals, country-by-country as well as local implementation plans will be required to  achieve  the  targets.  National  and  local  governments  need  to  take  the  lead  in  developing  and  implementing their own sustainable development strategies and action plans at different levels, based  on  the  proposed  SAI  principles  and  the  four  dimensions  of  sustainable  development.  Improved  measurement  of  development  outputs  and  outcomes  has  to  be  an  integral  part  of  this,  but  moving  beyond high-level global goals will also require solid business plans for development that provide a  roadmap for success. Countries and local stakeholders need to enter the sustainable development path  in  the  right  order  by  defining  their  priorities  and  assessing  the  feasibility  of  different  options.  Action  planning  needs  to  be  goal-oriented  and  systematic.  National  and  local  governments  should  apply  structured  assessment  and  business  planning  methodologies  to  analyze  how  various  solutions  could  contribute  to  meeting  one  or  more  specific  targets,  and  what  the  cost  of  different  options  is.  Researchers  must  play  an  important  role  in  guiding  this  process.  A  structured  assessment  and  backcasting approach typically includes five steps:   Background analysis: data collection, past trends and future projections, possible scenarios   Analyze data on problem relevance: define and characterize key problems/opportunities   Assess different technology/policy solutions (assumptions, timeframes, effectiveness, cost, etc.)   Estimate outcomes and effects at scale (direct and indirect effects)   Modeling of large-scale impact on development goals/targets: direct and indirect sectoral and  cross-sectoral benefits; cost vs. benefits   74  Interesting examples have recently been demonstrated for assessing technology paths for decarbonizing  Californias  energy  supply  through  such  a  backcasting  approach227,  or  for  climate  change  adaptation  planning in Ethiopia228.   Box 5-1. Some guiding principles for implementing Sustainable Agricultural Intensification              Governments  and  international  agencies  should  make sustainable  development of  agriculture  a priority  and support it through larger and sustained investments.   The  domestic  private  sector,  composed  of  millions  of  farmers  and  other  local  businesses,  is  by  far  the  biggest investor in agriculture and must be at the center of agricultural development strategies and plans.   Countries should weigh the costs, benefits and potential tradeoffs of specific steps to take, but within a  generic framework that aims to achieve transformative changes.  Countries  need  to  constantly  adjust  their  own  policies  to  remove  barriers,  take  advantage  of  new  technologies and create incentives for farmers, technology developers and the investment community to  develop workable options for deploying into agricultural systems.  Agricultural productivity growth in cereals and other staple food crops cannot be compromised because it  is essential for eradicating poverty and hunger.   Improvement of agriculture and food systems is a continuous, iterative process involving many public, civil  society  and  private  sector  stakeholders.  Many  small  steps  must  be  taken,  involving  learning  as  well  as  requiring behavior change by all actors involved. Multi-faceted approaches are needed to respond to the  diversity of farmers environments, objectives, constraints and incentives and to ensure proper targeting.  Thinking, policies and technologies from developed countries cannot be simply transferred to developing  and transition countries to dictate what is right or wrong, but all opportunities for North-South as well as  South-South sharing and learning should be exploited.  Specific  attention  must  be  paid  to  increasing  the  resilience  of  crop  and  livestock  systems,  adapting  agriculture  to  climate  change  and  climatic  extremes,  reducing  the  water  intensity  of  crop  production,  better  nutrient  management,  improved  animal  health,  and  halting  the  expansion  of  agriculture  into  natural ecosystems of ecological high value.  Greater  equity  is  needed  in  terms  of  access  to  inputs  and  markets  throughout  the  world  to  help  smallholders escape from poverty and resource depletion traps.    Farming,  and  the  broader  rural  agribusiness  sector,  must  provide  attractive  social  and  economic  development  opportunities  for  people  living  in  rural  areas,  particularly  women  and  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  young  people  who  will  soon  be  looking  for  jobs.  Women  are  key  drivers  of  change  in  agriculture.  They  need  to  be  empowered  along  the  whole  value  chain,  from  equal  access  to  land  to  opportunities for small business development in the agriculture and food sector.  Better  support  systems  are  needed  on  the  ground  to  accelerate  progress,  including  more  professional  extension  systems,  mobile  phone  technology,  soil  data,  real-time  weather  data,  reference  research  information, crop information, etc.   Implementing SAI should include efforts to integrate agriculture with other sectors to have greater impact,  particularly  on  health,  natural  resource  management,  disaster  risk  reduction,  gender,  education  and  energy.   Multiple stakeholders must be encouraged to participate in the SAI process. Programs and policy measures  should encourage business development, public-private partnerships, and other measures through which  a variety of sectors can work together on the ground.   The engagement of farmers, communities and consumers should increase.   Biophysical, economic, social and environmental metrics need to be collected in a comprehensive, reliable  manner  to  assess  different  policy  and  technology  options,  make  the  right  choices,  and  evaluate  the  performance of agriculture over time.  Countries should adopt open data policies.    Political  will  is  needed  to  implement  a  more  coordinated  and  business  approach  to  development,  including behavior change on the part of all participants. One of the major challenges is the alignment of  many actors who play different roles in development to ensure strategies are translated into tangible  75  outputs  and  outcomes  to  improve  food  security  and  nutrition  for  the  rural  and  urban  poor.  One  initiative which has shown some success is the development of Innovation Platforms to foster linkages  between the many players in a specific value chain. These Innovation Platforms or Innovation Hubs  bring together the public and private sectors, research and development, and actors at different places  in  the  value  chain  to  contribute  to  local  innovation  and  strengthened  chains.  Local  and  national  governments  are  often  overwhelmed  by  disparate  programs  operating  within  their  borders,  but  such  platforms  can  give  a  solid  base  from  which  to  drive  action  which  is  well  coordinated.  The  range  of  organizations to coordinate with includes:  Sustainable agriculture platforms and roundtables    National governments and local authorities   National agricultural research and extension systems   Universities   Civil society organizations (CSOs), including farmers associations    Private companies and industry associations    UN organizations such as FAO, WFP, UNEP, UNDP, and OECD   Global and regional political bodies and organizations   Global, regional and national initiatives, e.g., CAADP, G8 Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition,  AGRA,  African  Fertilizer  and  Agribusiness  Partnership  (AFAP),  Global  Partnership  on  Nutrient  Management (GPNM), Global Dryland Alliance (GDLA), Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN), etc.  Large  business-led  development corridors (e.g., WEF/New Vision for Agriculture)   (e.g.,  SAI  Platform  www.saiplatform.org)  and  initiatives,  platforms   Donors, development banks and funds, private foundations, and social/impact investors   International agricultural research centers, e.g., those forming the CGIAR and the Association of  International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture (AIRCA)   While  many  of  these  stakeholders  have  common  goals,  there  is  relatively  little  coordination  among  them along a commodity value chain in most developing countries compared to developed economies.  Often implementation measures to increase farm productivity and profitability is hampered by partners  not  knowing  how  individual  initiatives  stitch  together  to  support  a  robust  and  safe  food  system.  The  diversity of uncoordinated projects operating within a given country leads to fragmented, unsustainable  investments that seldom reach large scale. Key steps towards addressing this critical issue include:    Comprehensive, national and sub-national agricultural development strategies and investment  plans which follow an integrated, inclusive approach, are evidence-based, and are driven by the  needs  of  smallholder  farmers  and  local  entrepreneurs  to  become  successful  in  producing,  processing and marketing nutritious, safe food in an efficient and equitable manner.  Laws,  policies  and  implementation  offices  that  guide  and  coordinate  the  activities  of  multiple  actors  and  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  of  development  partners  for  outputs  in  support of national development goals.   Establishment of scalable systems that support stakeholder engagement, sharing of information  and practices, measurement, sustainability goal setting, training, extension, etc. so that diverse  stakeholders can focus their resources on making a meaningful difference.   The use of modern tools (e.g., mobile phones, satellite imagery, geospatial databases) to foster  linkages along value chains and stronger coordination and engagement with farmers to increase  the adoption of ecological intensification practices.   Scorecards that leverage digital technologies to provide more granular feedback to governments  on  their  progress  towards  SDGs  across  sectors,  including  the  contributions  of  multiple  actors  involved.   76  There  is  a  need  for  partner  mapping  within  each  country  to  enable  organizations  within  regions  and  along different commodity value chains to self-assemble and make strategic contributions to increase  value  chain  efficiency,  reduce  duplication  and  provide  farmer-preferred  inputs  and  services  while  supporting  equitable  market  opportunities  for  smallholder  farmers  and  their  families.  Providing  the  tools, many digitally enabled, to support value chain coordination and efficiency gains in service of farm  families  will  be  vital  for  success.  Mechanisms,  indicators  and  scorecards  should  be  created  that  incentivize  organizations  to  take  ownership  and  become  more  effective  in  reducing  poverty  and  increasing agriculture productivity in a sustainable manner. One example of this is the development of  seed roadmaps to ensure crop improvement programs are placing appropriate emphasis on the markets  and traits important to farmers through participatory testing and then build out seed production and  distribution plans in partnership with a wide range of local partners. This deliberate approach to variety  development and seed production and distribution puts in place the targets needed to realize national  seed requirements for farmer- and market-preferred crops.  Countries  and  international  donors  need  to  make  strong  investments  in  the  public  sector,  but  they  should also enable more sustainable business investment by creating infrastructure, providing security,  stopping  corruption,  protecting  human  rights,  encouraging  education,  and  more.  This  is  one  of  the  prerequisites for leveraging large private sector investments in smallholder farming and food systems in  developing  countries229.  With  these  in  place  private  investments  will  grow  and  publicprivate  partnerships  (PPP)  could  flourish  as  a  mechanism  for  implementing  concrete  solutions  in  different  farming situations and food chains. There is a growing desire on the part of governments, universities,  international institutions, and civil society organizations (CSOs) to work with the private sector, and vice  versa.  Experience  so  far  shows  that  PPPs  are  easy  to  talk  about  but  often  hard  to  make  work230.  Nevertheless,  some  good  examples  have  already  emerged  in  recent  years  which  have  demonstrated  success or promise at different scales such as smallholder input and service delivery systems, product  supply chains, R&D, and large-scale investment corridors (Box 5-2). The latter, while offering potential  solutions,  should  be  developed  in  close  consultation  with  local  stakeholders,  particularly  the  current  land users.  There is also a need for alternative funding approaches that complement the traditional funding of R&D.  \"Pull  mechanisms\"  are  results-based  financial  incentives  that  reward  successful  innovations  and  their  adoption,  to  overcome  market  failure  and  stimulate  more  private  sector  engagement  in  R&D231,232.  AgResults, launched by the G20 in 2010, is a new global initiative to enhance smallholder welfare and  improve food security for the poor and vulnerable through the use of \"pull mechanisms\" in agriculture.  Moving agriculture towards more sustainable productivity will require policy coherence and innovation  (Box  5-3).  These  must  often  be  coordinated  within  and  across  countries  to  achieve  transformative  change.  Needed  policy  reforms  include  those  that  increase  support  for  the  rural  sector  by  improving  infrastructure, strengthening capacities along value chain actors, and stimulating innovation. Economies  that are heavily dependent on agriculture sometimes tend to tax their rural sectors in favor of urban and  industrial  sectors.  However,  policies  that  support  agriculture  as  well  as  rural  infrastructure  and  enterprise  will  benefit  the  majority  of  the  population,  including  the  urban  sector.  A  comparison  with  experiences from middle-income countries in Southeast Asia reveals, for example, that (i) the historical  roots of economic success lie in pro-poor agricultural and rural development policies; (ii) even when it  has been pro-rural, African development strategy has often not necessarily been pro-poor; and (iii) pro- poor  agricultural  development,  not  export-oriented  industrialization,  should  be  the  first  priority  of  African states seeking to achieve sustained growth and poverty reduction233. A key policy objective will  be the support of capacity strengthening for the various stakeholder groups that are important for rural  development. This includes farmers (with youth and women requiring particular attention), extension   77  Box 5-2. Examples of public-private partnerships and business initiatives in agriculture and food systems  Unilever, Kenyan Tea Development Agency and the UK Government  The objective of this pilot is to seek out new methods for encouraging Kenyan smallholders to adopt  sustainable farming practices. Costs are shared between the UK government (DFID, 45%), Unilever (35%), the  Kenyan Government (18%) and Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR, ~2%). Results obtained so  far have shown yield improvements of between 5-15% and improved farmer incomes. This is now being rolled  out by the Kenyan Tea Development Agency to 500,000 farmers. Eco-certification is a key element in this  partnership.  Hybrid Rice Development Consortium (HRDC)  Small, medium and large seed companies engaged in hybrid rice breeding and commercialization need to have  access to traits, breeding materials, breeding support and other information generated by public sector  research. The Hybrid Rice Development Consortium (HRDC) was established by the International Rice Research  Institute (IRRI) in 2008 as a PPP model to advance hybrid rice development. It currently has 34 private  businesses and 34 public-sector institutions as members. Members of the HRDC provide feedback on hybrid  rice research priorities. Private sector members provide financial support through annual membership and  germplasm fees and in return gain access to diverse germplasm and other benefits, including training. HRDC  members can also seek bilateral collaboration with IRRI and other public sector partners. This mechanism has  allowed IRRI to increase its hybrid rice breeding capacity in a demand-driven, self-sustained manner. Within  four years it has led to a 10-fold increase in the volume of germplasm shared with both private and public  members of the HRDC. http://hrdc.irri.org   Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform  Food industries are the biggest purchasers of agricultural raw materials. In order to rely on a constant,  increasing and safe supply of agricultural raw materials, these must be grown in a sustainable manner. The SAI  Platform is a food industry organization to support the development of sustainable agriculture. The SAI  Platform today counts over 50 members. It aims at developing sustainable agriculture for mainstream  agricultural produce through a continuous improvement process that allows for more flexible adoption by  farmers worldwide. Examples of recent activities include principles and practices for sustainable water  management at farm level, recommendations for sustainability performance assessment, a standardized  methodology for the dairy sector to assess greenhouse gas emissions, and executive training on sustainable  sourcing. www.saiplatformaust.org   Grow Africa   Grow Africa is a partnership platform that seeks to accelerate private-sector investment in African agriculture  by supporting partner countries in developing investment blueprints, building a pipeline of investments, and  strengthening cross-sector collaboration. It provides support for innovative finance, risk management and  partnership building, with the intent of boosting smallholders and agricultural enterprises by tackling  constraints to their commercial viability. Grow Africa is based on national agricultural priorities in support of  the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP), with the World Economic Forum  (WEF) as a major convening partner. Goals for specific initiatives are defined by a countrys comparative  advantages and accessible market opportunities. Current initiatives focus on agricultural growth corridors in  Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania. Partners include the governments  of these countries, international donors, development organizations and private companies.  http://growafrica.com     78  services (including non-governmental groups), as well as enterprises that provide services and support  value  chains,  such  as  those  involved  in  finance,  input  supply,  transportation,  drying,  milling,  and  marketing.  Government  policies  on  agricultural  inputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizers,  pesticides  and  machinery are of particular importance for agriculture, but they sometimes provide wrong incentives or  result  in  barriers  that  slow  down  progress.  Well-targeted  fertilizer  subsidies  play  a  major  role  in  increasing  productivity  and  halting  soil  nutrient  depletion,  particularly  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  but  fertilizer subsidies can also lead to excessive or imbalanced use, or become a major economic burden  for a country if they become permanent, large entitlements that do not encourage adoption of better  management  practices.  Machines  are  often  handed  out  for  free  or  at  highly  subsidized  prices,  but  without  an  agribusiness  sector  that  provides  the  necessary  training  and  service  many  break  down  quickly  and  end  up  in  machine  graveyards  that  can  be  found  in  many  developing  countries.  This  contrasts with a very different, successful model - the small machines revolution (engines, pumps, hand  tractors,  tillers)  that  powered  the  Green  Revolution  in  Asia,  which  was  largely  driven  by  local  entrepreneurs234.  Could  this  be  a  suitable  model  for  Africa?  What  policies  could  enable  it?  Generally  speaking, input subsidies or credit schemes should become market-smart and target smallholders and  small entrepreneurs, e.g., through vouchers, grants, or loans to promote private sector solutions; they  should be temporary, not permanent; and they should be contract-based, with mechanisms that ensure  that contracts are being honored by everyone in the chain.  Intellectual  property  rights  (IPR),  regulations  for  acquiring,  sharing,  import  and  export  of  germplasm,  variety  release  systems,  seed  laws,  seed  subsidies  and  other  seed-related  policies  to  a  large  extent  influence  progress  in  breeding,  the  development  of  a  vibrant  seed  industry  with  numerous  local  businesses, and affordable access to new varieties by farmers. This is a rapidly changing area in which  countries constantly need to adjust their policies to address emerging technology opportunities. Barriers  to innovation that slow down the time to market or increase the cost of getting a new product to market  to a level that is only affordable by few companies with sufficient resources need to be removed235. For  the majority of crops it typically takes 12-15 years to breed, test, release and disseminate seed of a new  variety to farmers. This slow process is one of the reasons why many farmers cannot take advantage of  better varieties. The time from a cross made to quality seed in the hands of a farmer can be cut in half  through modern breeding technologies and the right government policies and support mechanisms for  speeding up release and seed commercialization through public and private channels. In India maize and  pearl millet yields grew significantly during the last two decades due partly to a combination of public  policies  that  encouraged  private  investment  in  India's  seed  industry  and  intellectual  property  rights  conferred by hybridization that addressed both the private sector's need for ownership as well as the  nation's need for productivity growth236.  Governments  should  design  and  implement  national  policies  that  are  modeled  after  the  Voluntary  guidelines  on  the  responsible  governance  of  tenure  of  land,  fisheries  and  forests  in  the  context  of  national food security151.  In  many  countries  this  may  require  placing constraints  on  the  conversion  of  natural  ecosystems  to  agriculture  or  policies  that  minimize  the  loss  of  productive  agricultural  land  to  industrialization  and  urbanization.  Economic  land  management,  water  resource  management  (e.g.,  water  pricing)  and  ecosystem  restoration.  Science- based  fisheries  policy  and  governance  reforms  are  needed  to  promote  a  complementary  role  of  sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture, and safeguard the diversity of global fish stocks51.  Information  and  communications  technologies  (ICTs)  have  much  to  offer  for  enhancing  planning  and  implementation  of  agricultural  transformation  processes.  While  ICTs  cannot  replace  interpersonal  interactions,  digital  communications  can  certainly  enhance  information  exchange  and  provide  the  analytical  power  needed  for  planning,  decision-making,  real-time  feedback  and  other  forms  of  instruments  should  be  used  for  sustainable  79  evaluation.  Besides  the  possibility  of  inexpensive  provision  of  information  to  populations  who  are  otherwise  relatively  isolated,  ICTs  have  the  potential  to  foster  exchange  of  information  among  households and communities, as well as crowd-sourcing of data and opinions.    Box 5-3. The enabling role of agricultural policies  New technologies are important, but policy and institutional reforms will be needed to align producer and  consumer incentives and thus implement transformative changes in agriculture and food systems. The general  principles (Chapter 2), goals, and targets for sustainable development (Chapter 3) as well as the available  solutions for SAI (Chapter 4) provide overall guidance for priority setting and choosing policy options.  Transparency, inclusiveness, good monitoring, critical review and dynamic adaptation of policies to specific,  changing contexts will determine whether the stated targets can be met. Development of policies is by nature  politically driven, based on the specific challenges faced in each country. Agricultural policies should support  systems-based approaches to improving sustainability performance on site-specific levels across nations and  regions. They must be developed with extensive stakeholder engagement to ensure that diverse perspectives  are considered and included. The outcomes of these policies must be monitored well through suitable  indicators, some of which could be internationally agreed and others nationally defined129. Countries, through  their policies, should aim to incentivize action by all actors towards more sustainable agricultural production  and food consumption practices. They should stimulate - not distort - the development of a vibrant,  competitive agribusiness sector that serves the needs of farmers and consumers. Critical areas to improve  include policies on agricultural trade and market access, prices, financing, food processing and safety,  consumer behavior, agricultural inputs and subsidies, land tenure, water rights and use, access to knowledge  and technology, rural infrastructure and labor, agricultural research and extension systems, protection of  ecosystems, and use of ecosystem services as well as gender roles, rural education and health. Many will  require substantial institutional reforms in many countries. Countries in which the poorest households spend a  large share of their income on food need to pay special attention to the stability of food prices, and establish  the necessary safety nets and social protection mechanisms. Regulation or protection are an important part of  good policy setting and governance, but such tools should be used with care, focusing on specific areas such as  protecting the poor, ensuring food safety, or protecting vulnerable natural assets, particularly forests, water  and fish stocks. Countries should also aim to share their experiences and align critical policies to overcome  present barriers for technology development and adoption and thus make faster progress in meeting their own  targets.  Actual implementation of policies must be monitored rigorously, and due attention should be given to  policy research to establish causality between specific policy initiatives and progress toward policy goals.   80    6. Concluding remarks The unique opportunity to eradicate poverty and hunger in our generation and make agriculture and  food  systems  more  sustainable  should  not  be  missed.  The  primary  objective  of  agriculture  -  which  cannot be compromised - is to produce enough food to sustainably feed 9 or 10 billion people by 2050.  This largely needs to be accomplished by crop and animal productivity increases, reducing food losses  and waste, and changing diets, always keeping in mind that the Earths natural resource base is finite. In  addition to the already common pressures of the past, our generation is facing new challenges: How to  make sure that we do not run out of water? How to preserve or improve soils? How to adapt to climatic  extremes?  Is the best future for many smallholder farmers to get out of farming? How do we create  better jobs and higher incomes for them in rural or urban areas? How do we ensure healthier diets and  lifestyles in all countries?   We live in an ever-changing world in terms of population, resource demands and constraints, climate,  and even political volatility. Meeting future food demand will require shifts in behavior as well as shifts  towards more sophisticated technologies, information and knowledge management systems for farming  systems  and  whole  value  chains,  but  also  policy-making,  and  market  and  incentive  systems  for  investment in ecosystem services.  We need to be realistic about the future of smallholder farming in developing countries. For many small  farming households exiting the agricultural sector may be the best strategy to overcome current poverty  traps  caused  by  resource  constraints  that  also  restrict  the  adoption  of  better  technologies.  Access  to  better  education  and  jobs  may  offer  future  generations  a  chance  for  a  different  perspective  on  life,  while those who remain in farming may have a greater chance to consolidate land holdings and thus  modernize many operations for greater income potential.  The 2015 to 2030 period must become a period of serious transition towards food systems that operate  based on SAI principles. It is possible to effectively end extreme poverty and hunger during this period,  but  it  will  probably  take  longer  to  completely  halt  and  reverse  all  of  the  negative  environmental  and  health  impacts  of  contemporary  food  systems.  However,  if  political  will,  governance  and  human  behavior can change as rapidly as science and technology emerge, policy coherence for development,  sustainable  agriculture  and  food  systems  can  become  the  new  global  standard,  not  the  exception.  Prosperous, healthy and resilient rural communities will be needed to produce the worlds future food  in a sustainable manner.  Concerted, coordinated action is needed, with increased, sustained investment in agriculture and rural  development.  We  need  to  make  farming  more  precise  and  more  attractive  to  systematically  improve  sustainability performance using new technology. We need new implementation models that can unlock  the  real  potential  of  the  public  and  private  sectors  in  addressing  complex  problems,  including  monitoring, learning, and prudently adapting. Markets alone are not enough; the private sector will also  have to change its business models, and good governance will be essential, including more restraint in  exploiting critical resources such as land, water, and forests.  Aspirations  of  maximum  consumption  should  be  replaced  by  patterns  of  optimized  consumption.  The  available  technical  solutions  are  well  advanced,  but  we  also  need  to  overcome  systemic  political,  economic and social barriers to change, which are substantial.  Strong multi-sectoral cooperation will be   needed to address the development challenges facing humanity and the planet.  81  References 1.   2.   3.   4.   5.   6.   7.   8.   9.   IFAD.

Rosegrant, IFPRI, IMPACT model predictions, adapted65. IMPACT covers 46 crops and livestock commodities and 115  countries/regions linked through international trade and 281 food production units. Demand is a function of prices, income,  and population growth. Crop production is determined by crop and input prices, the rate of productivity growth, and water  availability. The underlying data and model used make many assumptions about the future trajectories of food demand and  supply. Uncertainties associated with such projections are generally large and so are differences among countries and regions.   This  Business-As-Usual  scenario  assumes  a  continuation  of  current  trends  and  food  consumption,  agricultural  policies  and  investments  in  agricultural  productivity  growth.  Population  growth  is  the  median variant of the UN projections (esa.un.org/wpp). Real prices for major agricultural commodities  continue to rise due to increasing demand (population growth and per capita consumption), increasing  agricultural  land  prices,  and  land  and  water  constraints  to  expanding  production.  Meat  consumption  accelerates in developing countries, but also continues to increase in developed countries. Global per  capita consumption of meat would rise from 40.2 kg in 2010 to 44.8 kg in 2030 and 48.8 kg in 2050.  Total  meat  production  would  grow  by  34%  in  2030  relative  to  2010,  and  by  64%  in  2050.  Global  per  capita consumption of cereals would rise from 150 kg in 2010 to 151.6 kg in 2030 and 153.4 kg in 2050.  Cereals production would grow by 31% in 2030 (relative to 2010) and by 52% in 2050. World harvested  crop area would increase, putting additional pressure on natural resources. Use of fertilizers and other  inputs would continue to rise at current rates. Productivity and efficiency gains would be too small to  significantly  reduce  the  negative  environmental  impacts  of  agriculture.  It  would  also  be  difficult  to  eradicate poverty and food insecurity. The number of people at risk of hunger would  only decline by  around  20%,  from  918  million  in  2010  to  749  million  in  2050.  The  number  of  malnourished  children  would only decline by about 30%, from 164 million to 117 million.  This  scenario  illustrates  some  of  the  key  principles  and  interactions  involved  in  addressing  multiple  development goals through changes in agriculture and food systems. Productivity increases play a key  role in achieving the targets of future, sustainable agriculture. However, to eradicate poverty, hunger,  and other forms of malnutrition by 2030, crop and animal productivity growth rates would need to be  higher than in the BAU scenario. Furthermore, achieving all of the targets of sustainable agriculture and  food  systems,  including  better  environmental  stewardship,  protection  of  natural  resources,  and  healthier  human  beings,  requires  deeper,  transformative  changes  in  how  the  world  consumes  and  produces food. It can probably not be achieved through productivity and efficiency increases alone.  93  Annex 2. Sustainable Development Goals and Targets proposed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Goals and Targets are for 2030 unless otherwise noted. Targets marked with (*) need to be specified at  country or sub-national level. Each target will require one or more indicators to be developed at a later  stage.   PREAMBLEbb  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals  (MDGs) and aim to finish the job of ending extreme poverty in all its forms. The SDGs reaffirm the need  to  achieve  sustainable  development  by  promoting  economic  development,  social  inclusion,  environ- mental sustainability, and good governance including peace and security. These goals reaffirm human  rights and underscore the right to development as central objectives. They are universal and apply to all  countries,  national  and  local  governments,  businesses,  and  civil  society.  Sustainable  development  will  require that the goals be pursued in combination, rather than individually or one at a time.  GOAL 1: END EXTREME POVERTY INCLUDING HUNGERcc  End extreme poverty in all its forms (MDGs 1-7), including hunger, child stunting, malnutrition, and food  insecurity. Support highly vulnerable countries.   Target 1a. End absolute income poverty ($1.25 or less per day) and hunger, including achieving  food security and appropriate nutrition, and ending child stunting (MDG 1).  [Other suitably revised targets of MDGs 2-7 included here or below.]  Target 1b. Target 1c. Provide enhanced support for highly vulnerable states and Least Developed Countries,  to address the structural challenges facing those countries, including violence and  conflict.*  GOAL 2: ACHIEVE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN PLANETARY BOUNDARIES  All  countries  have  a  right  to  development  that  respects  planetary  boundaries,  ensures  sustainable  production and consumption patterns, and helps to stabilize the global population by mid-century.  Target 2a. Each country reaches at least the next income level as defined by the World Bank.dd  Target 2b. Countries report on their contribution to planetary boundaries and incorporate them,  together with other environmental and social indicators, into expanded GDP measures  and national accounts.*   Target 2c. Rapid voluntary reduction of fertility through the realization of sexual and reproductive  health rights in countries with total fertility rates above [3] children per woman and a                                                               bb Preamble based on the Rio+20 outcome document.  cc The term hunger as used here embraces various things, including child stunting, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  Appropriate indicators will need to be chosen to reflect the full spectrum of what constitutes hunger.  dd E.g. Low-Income Countries become at least Lower-Middle-Income Countries.    94  continuation of voluntary fertility reductions in countries where total fertility rates are  above replacement level.*  GOAL 3: ENSURE EFFECTIVE LEARNING FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH FOR LIFE AND LIVELIHOOD  All  girls  and  boys  complete  affordable  and  high-quality  early  childhood  development  programs,  and  primary  and  secondary  education  to  prepare  them  for  the  challenges  of  modern  life  and  decent  livelihoods.  All  youth  and  adults  have  access  to  continuous  lifelong  learning  to  acquire  functional  literacy, numeracy, and skills to earn a living through decent employment or self-employment.   Target 3c. All girls and boys have equal access to quality early childhood development (ECD)  programs.  Target 3d. All girls and boys receive quality primary and secondary education that focuses on  learning outcomes and on reducing the dropout rate to zero.   Target 3e. Youth unemployment rate is below [10] percent.   GOAL 4: ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY, SOCIAL INCLUSION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL  Ensure gender equality, human rights, the rule of law, and universal access to public services. Reduce  relative poverty and other inequalities that cause social exclusion. Prevent and eliminate violence and  exploitation, especially for women and children.  Target 4b. Monitor and end discrimination and inequalities in public service delivery, the rule of  law, access to justice, and participation in political and economic life on the basis of  gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, national origin, and social or other status.   Target 4c. Reduce by half the proportion of households with incomes less than half of the national  median income (relative poverty).  Target 4d. Prevent and eliminate violence against individuals, especially women and children.*  GOAL 5: ACHIEVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING AT ALL AGES  Achieve  universal  health  coverage  at  every  stage  of  life,  with  particular  emphasis  on  primary  health  services, including reproductive health, to ensure that all people receive quality health services without  suffering  financial  hardship.  All  countries  promote  policies  to  help  individuals  make  healthy  and  sustainable  decisions  regarding  diet,  physical  activity,  and  other  individual  or  social  dimensions  of  health.  Target 5a. Ensure universal access to primary healthcare that includes sexual and reproductive  healthcare, family planning, routine immunizations, and the prevention and treatment  of communicable and non-communicable diseases.ee  Target 5b. End preventable deaths by reducing child mortality to [20] or fewer deaths per 1000  births, maternal mortality to [40] or fewer deaths per 100,000 live births, and mortality  under 70 years of age from non-communicable diseases by at least 30 percent compared  with the level in 2015.ff                                                               ee We recommend that countries retain suitably updated MDG indicators for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.  ff Countries that have achieved the mortality targets should set more ambitious aggregate targets that are commensurate with  their development and ensure that the minimum quantitative targets are achieved for every sub-population.  95  Target 5c. Promote healthy diets and physical activity, discourage unhealthy behaviors, such as  smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and track subjective wellbeing and social capital.*  GOAL 6: IMPROVE AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS AND RAISE RURAL PROSPERITY  Improve farming practices, rural infrastructure, and access to resources for food production to increase  the productivity of agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, raise smallholder incomes, reduce environmental  impacts, promote rural prosperity, and ensure resilience to climate change.   Target 6a. Ensure sustainable food production systems with high yields and high efficiency of  water, soil nutrients, and energy, supporting nutritious diets with low food losses and  waste.*  Target 6b. Halt forest and wetland conversion to agriculture, protect soil and land resources, and  ensure that farming systems are resilient to climate change and disasters.*  Target 6c. Ensure universal access in rural areas to basic resources and infrastructure services  (land, water, sanitation, modern energy, transport, mobile and broadband  communication, agricultural inputs, and advisory services).  GOAL 7: EMPOWER INCLUSIVE, PRODUCTIVE, AND RESILIENT CITIES  Make  all  cities  socially  inclusive,  economically  productive,  environmentally  sustainable,  secure,  and  resilient  to  climate  change  and  other  risks.  Develop  participatory,  accountable,  and  effective  city  governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation.  Target 7a. End extreme urban poverty, expand employment and productivity, and raise living  standards, especially in slums.*  Target 7b. Ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban  Target 7c. services including housing; water, sanitation and waste management; low-carbon  energy and transport; and mobile and broadband communication.   Ensure safe air and water quality for all, and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas  emissions, efficient land and resource use, and climate and disaster resilience into  investments and standards.*  GOAL 8: CURB HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENSURE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY   Curb greenhouse gas emissions from energy, industry, agriculture, the built environment, and land-use  change to ensure a peak of global CO2 emissions by 2020 and to head off the rapidly growing dangers of  climate change.gg Promote sustainable energy for all.  Target 8a. Decarbonize the energy system, ensure clean energy for all, and improve energy  efficiency, with targets for 2020, 2030, and 2050.*  Target 8b. Reduce non-energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases through improved practices  in agriculture, forestry, waste management, and industry.*  Target 8c. Adopt incentives, including pricing greenhouse gas emissions, to curb climate change  and promote technology transfer to developing countries.*                                                               gg The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC (2007) has defined this level as global average temperatures that are 2C above  the pre-industrial level. Recent scientific evidence suggests the need to reduce the long-term temperature increase to 1.5C  or less. The global emission reduction target should be regularly updated in view of the growing body of scientific evidence.    96  GOAL 9: SECURE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND BIODIVERSITY, AND ENSURE GOOD MANAGEMENT OF  WATER AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES  Biodiversity, marine and terrestrial ecosystems of local, regional, and global significance are inventoried,  managed, and monitored to ensure the continuation of resilient and adaptive life support systems and  to support sustainable development.hh Water and other natural resources are managed sustainably and  transparently to support inclusive economic and human development.   Target 9a. Ensure resilient and productive ecosystems by adopting policies and legislation that  address drivers of ecosystem degradation, and requiring individuals, businesses and  governments to pay the social cost of pollution and use of environmental services.*  Target 9b. Participate in and support regional and global arrangements to inventory, monitor, and  protect biomes and environmental commons of regional and global significance and  curb trans-boundary environmental harms, with robust systems in place no later than  2020.   Target 9c. All governments and businesses commit to the sustainable, integrated, and transparent  management of water, agricultural land, forests, fisheries, mining, and hydrocarbon  resources to support inclusive economic development and the achievement of all  SDGs.*  GOAL 10: TRANSFORM GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  The public sector, business, and other stakeholders commit to good governance, including transparency,  accountability,  access  to  information,  participation,  an  end  to  tax  and  secrecy  havens,  and  efforts  to  stamp  out  corruption.  The  international  rules  governing  international  finance,  trade,  corporate  reporting,  technology,  and  intellectual  property  are  made  consistent  with  achieving  the  SDGs.  The  financing of poverty reduction and global public goods including efforts to head off climate change are  strengthened and based on a graduated set of global rights and responsibilities.   Target 10a. Governments (national and local) and business commit to the SDGs, transparent  monitoring, and annual reports - including independent evaluation of integrated  reporting for all major companies starting no later than 2020.*  Target 10b. Adequate domestic and international public finance for ending extreme poverty,  providing global public goods, capacity building, and transferring technologies, including  0.7 percent of GNI in ODA for all high-income countries, and an additional $100 billion  per year in official climate financing by 2020.  Target 10c. Rules for international trade, finance, taxation, business accounting, and intellectual  property are reformed to be consistent with and support achieving the SDGs.                                                               hh In line with the Aichi Biodiversity targets to be achieved by 2020.  97  Annex 3. Composite indices and tools for analysis, decision making and communication  Many composite indices and other decision or communication tools have been proposed in recent years  to score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems. Generally speaking, many of them suffer  from  three  basic  shortcomings:  (i)  the  quality  of  the  underlying  component  data,  (ii)  scoring  of  qualitative data, and (ii) correlation and weighting of the various quantitative or qualitative component  indicators.  Nevertheless,  composite  indices  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  communicating  to  a  broader audience the multiple dimensions of food security and sustainable agricultural development in  user-friendly  numbers,  charts  and  tables.  They  are  thus  an  integral  part  of  decision-making  and  implementation strategies aimed at changing behavior and triggering more action at different levels. In  general,  composite  indices,  footprint  tools  or  similar  approaches  should  be  (i)  science-based;  (ii)  outcome-  and  action-oriented  (iii)  applicable  at  different  scales,  from  the  farm  and  value  chain  scale  (where the change must happen) to the national scale (where progress towards meeting targets must  be measured); (iv) capable of measuring trends over time, and (v) primarily based on credible, publicly  available  data.  Preference  should  be  given  to  tools  that  are  based  on  well-defined,  measurable  components that can stand on their own and are also linked to key indicators for measuring progress  towards achieving SDG targets (see Chapter 3.2.).    For illustration we provide six different examples:  The  Global  Hunger  Index  (GHI)237  is  designed  to  comprehensively  measure  and  track  hunger  globally  and  by  country  and  region.  Calculated  each  year,  the  GHI  aims  to  highlight  successes  and  failures  in  hunger reduction, raise awareness and help understand regional and country differences in hunger to  trigger further action. To reflect the multidimensional nature of hunger, the GHI combines three equally  weighted indicators into one index number: Undernourishment: the proportion of undernourished as a  percentage of the population; Child Underweight: the proportion of children under age of five who are  underweight; and Child Mortality: the mortality rate of children under age of five. www.ifpri.org/book- 8018/ourwork/researcharea/global-hunger-index  The Global Food Security Index (GFSI) considers four core issues of food security across 105 countries:  affordability, availability, quality and safety. The index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative scoring  model, constructed from 25 unique indicators, that measures these drivers of food security across both  developing  and  developed  countries.  It  includes  several  unique  qualitative  indicators,  many  of  which  relate  to  government  policy,  to  capture  drivers  of  food  security  which  are  not  currently  measured  in  other  international  datasets.  The  GFSI  is  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  adjust  for  the  impact  of  fluctuating food prices. Its major goal is to assess in a timely manner which countries are most and least  vulnerable to food insecurity. foodsecurityindex.eiu.com  The  Womens  Empowerment  in  Agriculture  Index  (WEAI)  measures  the  empowerment,  agency,  and  inclusion  of  women  in  the  agriculture  sector  to  identify  ways  to  overcome  those  obstacles  and  constraints. It  aims  to  increase  understanding  of  the  connections  between  womens  empowerment,  food security, and agricultural growth. It measures the roles and extent of womens engagement in the  agriculture sector in five domains: (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decision  making  power  over  productive  resources,  (3)  control  over  use  of  income,  (4)  leadership  in  the  community,  and  (5)  time  use.  The  five  domains  comprise  ten  indicators.  Each  domain  is  weighted  equally,  as  are  each  of  the  indicators  within  a  domain.  The  WEAI  identifies  women  who  are  disempowered and tries to understand how autonomy and decision-making can be increased. The WEAI   98  is also a useful tool for tracking progress toward gender equality, which is one of the current Millennium  Development Goals. www.ifpri.org/publication/womens-empowerment-agriculture-index  National Water Security Index (NWSI)238 The Asian Water Development Outlook measures the overall  national  water  security  as  the  composite  result  of  five  interdependent  dimensions,  because  a  single  focus on any of these is insufficient to guide decisions or assess outcomes in the water sector. The five  dimensions are (1) Household water security, (2) Economic water security, (3) Urban water security, (4)  Environmental water security, and (5) Resilience to water-related disasters. Each of the five dimensions  is measured on a scale of 1-5 (1 = Hazardous, 5 = Exemplary) using 3-4 sub-indices (indicators) for each  dimension.  The  NWSI  is  calculated  as  the  populated-weighted  average  of  the  five  key  dimensions  of  water security, and further aggregated up to sub-regions. Countries and regions with a low overall NWSI  are described as hot spots, where additional efforts and targeted investments are required. The NWSI  can be used to track progress at country and regional scale towards improving water security as a whole  and for its various components. www.adb.org/publications/asian-water-development-outlook-2013  The Rice Bowl Index (RBI) is a public-private sector initiative that aims to provide a platform for joint  action  between  various  governmental  and  non-governmental  stakeholders.  The  tool  serves  as  a  common  language  for  different  stakeholders  to  engage  in  purposeful  dialogue  leading  to  solutions- oriented  action.  The  RBI  consists  of  a  quantitative  and  a  qualitative  component,  which  are  currently  measured  for  14  countries  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  The  quantitative  component  is  a  modular  diagnostic platform examining the key enablers and disablers of food security. The RBI defines these as  Demand  &  Price;  Environmental  Factors;  Farm-level  Factors;  and  Policy  and  Trade.  Each  driver  is  a  composite of 4-9 different metrics and proxies which are measured by using publicly available data, such  as  consumer  price  index,  cereal  yield,  arable  land,  food  consumption,  infrastructure,  and  water  availability. The qualitative component is a white paper (and an update  is published every 6 months)  which interprets the platform data and identifies areas which require increased attention in terms of the  development  of  appropriate  policy  solutions,  investment  in  technology  and  infrastructure,  and  the  creation of economic opportunities for farmers and the communities in which they live and work.  www.ricebowlindex.com  Field  to  Market  including  producer  organizations,  agribusinesses,  food  companies,  conservation  organizations  and  other  not-for-profit  organizations,  universities,  and  agency  partners  in  the  USA.  It  aims  to  create  opportunities  across  the  agricultural  supply  chain  for  continuous  improvements  in  productivity,  environmental  quality,  and  human  well- being. A national report is published every four years (last report: 2012) to assess environmental and  socioeconomic  indicators  for  measuring  outcomes  of  on-farm  agricultural  production  in  the  United  States. The report analyzes trends over time in major agricultural crops at the national scale. Its first part  analyzes five environmental indicators (land use, soil erosion, irrigation water applied, energy use, and  greenhouse gas emissions), each of which is presented in three formats: resource use/impact per unit of  production, resource use/impact per acre, and total resource use/impact. For ease of communication,  trends are shown in spider diagrams for 5-year periods, with 2000 as reference year. In a second part,  six  socioeconomic  indicators  (debt/asset  ratio,  returns  above  variable  costs,  crop  production  contribution to national and state gross domestic product, non-fatality injury, fatality, and labor hours)  are  assessed.  Moreover,  a  Fieldprint  Calculator  is  available  online  as  an  educational  tool  designed  to  help farmers assess how their own operational decisions affect overall sustainability performance. The  calculator is an easy way to find out how a farmers current land use, energy use, water use, greenhouse  gas emissions, and soil loss compare with state and national averages.   www.fieldtomarket.org  is  an  alliance  of  nearly  fifty  organizations  99  The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) engages scientists, engineers, business and civil society leaders, and development practitioners for evidence-based problem solving.
